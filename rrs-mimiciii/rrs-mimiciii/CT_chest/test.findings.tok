there is an intramural hematoma of the thoracic aorta extending from the aortic root and continuing throughout the chest into the visualized portion of the upper abdomen. these images extend to immediately below the esophageal hiatus, but not further below. although filling of the celiac and common hepatic arteries is demonstrated on the most inferior images, the abdominal aorta and its major branches cannot be evaluated further by this study, accordingly. there is a primary site of ulceration of the ascending aorta beyond the left branch point to the left carotid artery, but prior to the takeoff of the left brachialcephalic artery. extending from the point of ulceration in both directions is a false lumen with contrast filling which extends proximally toward the aortic root. the calcified left and right coronary arteries fill with contrast, but are at risk as the intramural hematoma extends to their origins. distally, beyond the point of communication between the true and false lumens, the false lumen is seen to extend distally toward the apex of the aortic arch along a distal extent of about 2.5 cm. however, as this is a single phase study in the early arterial phase, the possibility of more distal extent of contrast filling of the false lumen on a slightly longer time scale cannot be excluded on this study. in addition, there is a focus of ulceration with intramural hematoma at the proximal right brachiocephalic artery, immediately prior to the origin of the right carotid, which is surrounded with intramural hematoma that extends distally around the right common carotid. the more superior portion of the imaged right common carotid appears normal, however. the left common carotid and brachiocephalic arteries fill normally with contrast and do not appear involved. intramural hematoma extends to the most superior abdomen, and presumably below the imaged region, which cannot be evaluated here. there is also an additional focus of high density, within the intramural hematoma in the descending portion of the aorta, anteriorly, at the level of the left atrium, associated with a third separate focus of ulceration. the mid proximal ascending aorta has a true lumen of 25 x 32 mm in axial dimensions, and including the hematoma in the wall measures up to 41 x 47 mm axially. at the root the contrast filled true lumen measures 39 x 37 mm at the aortic root. there is no mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy. no evidence of pulmonary embolism is identified. there is extensive emphysema bilaterally, and biapical scarring. there are small bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the left than the right, with bibasilar fibrosis, particularly conspicuous at the right base. there is a large hiatal hernia. otherwise, the partially visualized upper abdominal organs are unremarkable.

there is interval development of a sizable left pneumothorax with perhaps slight shift of the mediastinal contents towards the right since ct torso of ___. also note is made that the patient has left-sided anterior chest tube is not within the pleural cavity and terminates within the subcutaneous soft tissues of the anterolateral chest wall. there is subcutaneous gas along bilateral anterior chest wall. also, there is apparent gas within the anterior mediastinum (2:16), and also along the right heart margin (2:4, 31, 57). the central airways are patent to the subsegmental levels. there are areas of consolidation in the dependent portions involving all lobes of the lungs, possibly representing atelectasis and possible aspiration. additionally, there are multiple foci of peribronchovascular nodules and consolidation which are most prominent in the left upper lobe, right middle lobe and right lower lobe, worrisome for multifocal pneumonia. there is no pleural effusion or pericardial effusion. while the study is degraded by motion, no evidence for large or central pulmonary embolus is seen. assessment is particularly limited in the lingula. no mediastinal, hilar or axillary adenopathy is noted. again noted is thymic tissue remnant. no evidence of acute fracture seen. vertebral body heights are preserved.
there are multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. for example, two adjacent right paratracheal nodes measure 16 x 12 and 15 x 13 mm in axial dimensions, respectively. more superiorly, a right upper paratracheal lymph node measures 15 x 13 mm, and a subcarinal node measures 28 x 17 mm. there is also lymphadenopathy in the right hilum, with a node measuring up to 18 x 11 mm. there is no axillary lymphadenopathy. it is difficult to assess for left hilar lymphadenopathy because of the presence of a partially collapsed left lung. the heart, great vessels, and pericardium are unremarkable. there is no pericardial effusion or evidence of pulmonary embolism. there is a moderately large pneumothorax in the left hemithorax, in spite of the presence of a chest tube. there is also a small left pleural effusion. in the left hemithorax, neither the lower or upper lobe has fully reexpanded and both appear surrounded by visceral pleural thickening, particularly the upper lobe. there are also atelectatic changes within the residual lobes and ground glass opacity. in the right lung, there are multiple areas of ground glass opacity and septal thickening. in comparison to the chest radiographs, this appearance has progressed over two days, and although the appearance is nonspecific by imaging, pulmonary edema is suspected. limited views of the upper abdomen are unremarkable.
over 20 days a right apical lung mass has grown to 16 x 17mm from 11 x 15 mm (3:14). the left apical lung nodule, 7.1 x 15 mm, a 3mm upper lobe nodule (3:16), and a 2.6mm right upper lobe nodule (3:27) with a rounded central lucency are all stable. th large left hilar mass is stable in size but more completely occludes the the left basal bronchial trunk with complete collapse of the left lower lobe. the left pleural effusion has increased, now moderate to severe, although no pleural mass is seen. there is no right pleural effusion. small pericardial effusion is stable, with no evidence of cardiad tamponade. heart size is normal. among sultiple, pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, some have grown: the 2.7 x 2.5 cm subcarinal lymph node was previously 2.2 x 2.1 cm.. a well-defined sclerotic region in the posterior one-third of a mid thoracic vertebral body is likely a bone island. no ill-defined sclerotic lesions suspicious for metastases are seen. the limited evaluation of the abdomen shows a progressive increase in the size of the cystic splenic lesion arising from the upper pole of the spleen 30 x 30 mm; when first identified on the ___, it measured 8.5 mm. the gallbladder has been removed. the limited evaluation of the abdomen demonstrates no definite abnormality although the previous examination detected some tiny hypodense lesions too small to characterize on this examination.
due to a combination of poor peripheral opacification and motion artifact, the subsegmental pulmonary arteries are not well shown. however, there is no evidence of a central pulmonary embolism. a tracheostomy tube and right subclavian central venous catheter are in satisfactory position. anterior bowing of the posterior tracheal membrane leads to subtotal collapse of the upper trachea, approximately 5 mm below the tip of the endotracheal tube (401b:32). mid and lower tracheal collapse is also severe, but less marked. similarly, there is severe collapse of the main bronchi bilaterally and evidence of air trapping in both lungs, particularly the left upper lobe. bilateral lower lobe atelectasis is moderately severe, segmental consolidation in the right lower lobe suggests concomitant segmental pneumonia. bilateral pleural effusions appear nonhemorrhagic and are small with a trace of right minor fissural fluid and adjacent compressive atelectasis. mild mediastinal nodal prominence is likely reactive to the consolidation. the cardiac size is normal without evidence of pericardial effusion. coronary artery and thoracic aortic arch atherosclerotic calcification is mild-to-moderate. descending thoracic aortic calcification is moderately severe. the study is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, only to confirm a small sliding hiatal hernia, and a gastrostomy tube. the visualized osseous structures are unremarkable aside from mid and lower thoracic spine endplate irregularity.
