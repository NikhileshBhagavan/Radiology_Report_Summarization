there are fractures at the c6 vertebral body on the left involving the pedicle as well as the lamina (2:108). in addition, a linear lucency seen best on coronal images (301:23) at the left pedicle of c5 is equivocal for a fracture at that location. there is no evidence of acute traumatic fracture. the vertebral bodies are notable for extensive degenerative change, with slight loss of height at c4, c5, and c6. in addition, there is loss of intervertebral disc height at c4-5, c5-6 and c6-7. notably at these levels, there is posterior osteophyte formation, which appears to narrow the central spinal canal at those levels. regional vascular structures are notable for a hypoplastic left vertebral artery, there is no evidence of traumatic arterial injury. there is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling. the intracranial contents were better characterized on the ct head comparison. the lung apices are better visualized on the ct of the torso. the regional soft tissue structures appear unremarkable.
there is enlargement of the left parotid and submandibular glands. the left parotid enlargement can best be appreciated on (2:19) and asymmetric enlargement of the submandibular gland can best be appreciated on (2:28). in addition, there are left-sided prominent lymph nodes with an intraparotid lymph node best seen on (2:15) measuring 16 x 9 mm, and two subjacent submandibular lymph nodes best seen on (2:24) each measuring 13 mm in their short axis. these lymph nodes are likely reactive in nature, with associated surrounding fat stranding suggestive of an inflammatory process. given the proximity of the fat stranding and lymphadenopathy to both the parotid and submandibular glands and given the asymmetric enlargement of both, the origin of this inflammatory process is not clear and could be either related to the submandibular or parotid gland, or also may be related to a cellulitis within this area. no fluid collections are seen in this area that would be concerning for abscess, however evaluation is limited with lack of intravenous contrast. there are no high-density calcifications that would be concerning for sialolithiasis. there is a small calcification in the floor of the mouth in the midline that is not along the course of a major salivary duct. the patient is status post intubation, a nasogastric tube placement. in addition, the patient is status post central venous catheter placement with catheter seen coursing through the left subclavian vein. there are bilateral right greater than left pleural effusions. in addition, there is nonspecific ground-glass opacity seen within both lung apices. there is mucosal thickening involving the ethmoid, sphenoid and maxillary sinuses, and the mastoid air cells are opacified. no other areas of lymphadenopathy are identified. evaluation of the parapharyngeal soft tissues is limited in the presence of the endotracheal tube.

compared to prior ct from ___, there is decreased opacification of the right internal jugular vein throughout its nearly entire course. intraluminal thrombus cannot be excluded. given the timing of the bolus, optimal evaluation for clot is limited. no additional soft tissue mass lesions are identified. limited views of the carotid arteries demonstrate no marked area of stenosis. note should be made that the study ordered and acquired is not ct angiogram. osseous structures are unremarkable.
there is severe plaque and calcification formation at the bifurcation of the left carotid artery. there is a 3 cm segment of severe stenosis extending cephalad from the left carotid bifurcation. the lumen distal to the stenosis is partially collapsed and measures 3.5 mm in diameter. the narrowest portion of the stenotic segment measures 1.4 mm for a measured 60% stenosis. there is a lesser degree of plaque and calcium seen at the right carotid bifurcation. at the bifurcation, the diameter of the right internal carotid artery measures 3 mm, just cephalad the artery measures 5 mm, indicating a 40% stenosis. calcifications are seen at the origins of both the left and right vertebral arteries, associated with mild narrowing. the vertebral arteries are otherwise patent throughout their course without focal areas of stenosis. there is an aneurysm clip seen within the right middle cranial fossa, which produces a large amount of streak artifact. the adjacent vessels are suboptimally imaged. there are calcifications of the cavernous portion of the carotid arteries, without evidence of aneurysm. the vessels of the circle of ___ are patent without evidence of aneurysm. the intracranial cerebral arteries are incompletely imaged with this protocol. there is suboptimal evaluation of the intracranial contents but no gross abnormalities are identified. the lung apices are clear. no abnormal soft tissue densities are seen within the soft tissues of the neck. multiplanar reformats confirm the above findings.

the bilateral internal, external, and common carotid arteries demonstrate no evidence for dissection or aneurysm. no extravasation is identified. the right vertebral artery demonstrates normal course and caliber with no evidence for dissection. the left vertebral artery in its v1 and v2 segments is unremarkable in course and caliber. the previously demonstrated segmental narrowing seen in the v2 segments on the previous cerebral angiogram is not present on this examination and therefore likely represented spasm rather than dissection. in the v3 segment of the left vertebral artery, there is a large amount of artifact, which precludes evaluation of this segment for dissection. however, accounting for this, no definite evidence for dissection is identified. the v4 segments demonstrate no evidence for dissection, stenosis, or aneurysm. there is an unchanged comminuted fracture through the ramus of the right mandible. there are multiple calcific and metallic fragments are seen surrounding the fracture site. on the left side, there is a large metallic foreign body consistent with a bullet, which is medial to the left mandibular ramus. there is a comminuted anterior fracture of c1 involving the anterior tubercle. otherwise, no other fractures are identified. there is mucosal thickening and the bilateral maxillary sinus. opacification and fluid is seen within the nasal cavity as well as in the ethmoid air cells.
overlying the right mandible, significant beam hardening and streak artifact resulting from dental hardware limits evaluation. however, there is no identifiable abscess or fluid collection in this region. slight asymmetry of the soft tissues, with a small region of hyoattenuation seen adjacent to the mandible, may reflect a degree of soft tissue edema. a more superficially located low-density oblong structure has attenuation of -80 to-100 ___, consistent with fat. the underlying osseous structures are unremarkable without sclerosis or erosions. there are no foci of abnormal contrast enhancement. the overlying subcutaneous fat demonstrates no induration or fat stranding. in the neck, there are scattered, slightly prominent level 2 lymph nodes, which are not clearly pathologic by imaging criteria. however, given their slight prominence and the patient's history of lymphoma, the possibility of lymphomatous nodal involvement must be considered. in comparison to ct obtained with most recent pet scan in ___, it is difficult to determine whether there have been changes in these nodes, as the prior ct was performed without contrast. there was increased fdg uptake in the neck at that time, in regions roughly corresponding to the nodes seen on the current exam. moreover, lack of intravenous contrast on the prior study and the patient's relative lack of subcutaneous fat planes makes precise comparison difficult. there is no other abnormal soft tissue lesions appreciated. the parotid, sublingual and submandibular glands are unremarkable. although study is not tailored to evaluation of the great vessels, there is no evidence for venous thrombosis or arterial abnormality. the visualized oronasopharynx is normal without exophytic mucosal masses. the visualized paranasal sinuses demonstrate minimal mucosal thickening, but are otherwise clear. osseous structures are unremarkable without evidence for fracture.

in place of previously seen central low density 2 x 2 cm soft tissue lesion (presumably a centrally necrotic left level iii node) is an irregular, infiltrative predominantly low density collection with even more infiltrative margins. margins between this area and surrounding, abnormal lymph nodes is obscured. overall area of conglomerate nodes/necrotic tissue measures approximately 6.6 cm cc x 4.6 cm trv x 4.4 cm ap. there is complete encasement of the distal left common carotid and proximal internal carotid arteries. the adjacent internal jugular vein is now severely attenuated at this level (4:42), suspicious for a focal thrombus (4:43). ij had been patent on prior. there is significant mass effect on the hypopharynx and larynx which are deviated to the right. soft tissue mass apparently encases the upper ___ of the thyroid cartilage and effaces the left piriform sinus. there is loss of the fat plane between the lesion and the longus coli posteriorly. the lesion abuts the left thyroid lobe, which is enlarged and heterogeneous with neighboring stranding (4:62). discrete local lymphadenopathy includes a 2.3 x 1.5 cm necrotic node just lateral to the left thyroid lobe (4:59) and a 17 mm necrotic node just superior to the thyroid (4:78), both larger since the prior study. numerous enlarged left cervical nodes are also present (4:40). no bony erosions are detected. included views of the brain parenchyma and circle of ___ are normal. mild mucosal thickening is seen within the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses (4:9). the middle ear cavities and mastoid air cells are clear. included views of the lung apices are clear.
endotracheal tube is in place, tip noted to be at the ostium of the right mainstem bronchus. there is extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the soft tissues of the right neck, with smaller amounts of subcutaneous gas seen in the left neck, tracking along the sternocleidomastoid, and inferiorly along the anterior scalene musculature. evaluation of the soft tissues is limited without intravenous contrast and dental streak artifacts. there is a moderate amount of edema or fluid in the posterior and inferior oropharynx, but no sign of narrowing of the endotracheal tube. there is no discrete fluid collection, or other findings to suggest abscess formation. small air-fluid level, and partial opacification is seen in the sphenoid air cells, and ethmoid air cells. moderate bilateral pleural effusions, and adjacent atelectasis are unchanged from previous ct. extensive white matter hypodensities are noted, consistent with chronic microangiopathic change.

the upper airway is patent. the piriform sinuses are asymmetric, but no definite mass is seen. the trachea and right mainstem bronchus are patent. the left mainstem bronchus is completely obstructed, similar to prior, and complete collapse of the left lung is better seen on same-day chest ct. numerous new right apical pulmonary nodules are better characterized on same-day ct. the upper esophagus is mildly dilated and contains an air-fluid level (2:20), with ill-defined soft tissue (4:103) present distal to the site of dilatation. this is concerning for tumor involvement of the esophagus with extrinsic compression. new left supraclavicular lymph nodes measure up to 4.7 x 1.9 cm (4:99). the thyroid and salivary glands are normal. there has been interval increase in direct tumor invasion of the t3 and t4 vertebral bodies, with new extension of tumor into the spinal canal (301b:36). there is near-complete loss of t3 vertebral body height and loss of t4 vertebral body height. a 1.6-cm lytic lesion involving the posterior aspect of t5 is better imaged on the same-day ct. a well-corticated osseous fragment superior to c2 is compatible with either an os odontoideum or a chronic dens fracture.

compared to the most recent evaluation, there has been interval removal of left supraclavicular and anterior drains. overall, there has been interval decrease in the size of fluid collections and surrounding inflammation, predominantly involving the left neck. a fluid-density collection with an enhancing rim, located within the left supraclavicular tissues is again identified and measures 2.5 x 1.3 x 3.9 cm (2:26, 103b:30). overall this fluid collection appears to be significantly decreased in size compared to ___. a few foci of air are still present within the soft tissues of the left neck, but are overall much decreased in size compared to the previous examinations. a crescentic-shaped focus of air at the level of the thyroid near the original drains were placed remains present. limited views of the lung apices demonstrate bilateral pleural effusions and centrilobular emphysema. there has been osseous destruction of the left vertebral foramen at the level of c6-7 and marked dilatation of the left vertebral artery is noted. this dilated focus measures 1.5 x 1.2 cm which is increased in size compared to the previous evaluation of 1.2 x 0.9 cm (series 2, image 22). these findings are consistent with a focal pseudoaneurysm and are confirmed on the coronal and sagittal images. screw tracks from the previously present anterior hardware fixation of the c5 and c6 vertebral bodies are noted. sagittal images demonstrate some posterior displacement into the spinal canal of the c6 vertebral body causing moderate spinal canal stenosis at this level. there are destructive changes of the c6 and c7 vertebral bodies which may due to abnormal motion after removal of hardware but given the gas collection immediately anterior to this region, osteomyelitis must be considered. a small amount of mucosal thickening within the right maxillary sinus is noted and overall appears improved compared to the previous evaluation. there has been interval resolution of fluid within the left maxillary sinus.
a clot is identified within the right internal jugular vein. the clot extends into the right brachiocephalic vein. there is moderate expansion of the right internal jugular vein, which measures 2.5 x 2.5 cm in greatest cross- sectional diameter. no contrast opacification is seen within the lumen. the thrombus extends up to the skull base. a smaller low attenuation rounded focus is present anterior to the right internal jugular vein. this likely represents clot within the right external jugular vein. a small, 8 x 9 mm lymph node is seen at the right mandibular angle. this does not meet criteria for pathologic enlargement. no other neck masses are present. the carotid vessels, right subclavian vein, vertebral arteries, and left internal jugular vein are normally opacified. opacified venous collaterals are seen in the posterior paraspinous region. the visualized brain parenchyma is unremarkable. there are no osseous abnormalities. the mastotid air cells, sphenoid air cells, and visualized portions of the ethmoid air cells are normally aerated.
the study is compared with the craniocervical mri and mra obtained some eight hours earlier, as well as the cranial cta obtained the previous day. again demonstrated is a large acute infarct within the left mca territory, particularly its superior division, with some mass effect and effacement of the overlying gyri, but no shift of the normally-midline structures. there is no finding to specifically suggest hemorrhagic conversion. again demonstrated is hyperattenuation of the visualized entirety of the m1 and m2 segments of the left mca, corresponding to known thrombus. the cta demonstrates continued filling defects within the m1 and m2 segments of this vessel, (3:231-239), as well as within the left carotid terminus (3:225-228). however, the overall appearance of the intracranial left ica is significantly improved, with otherwise resumption of normal opacification, with some segmental narrowing of, particularly its petrous portion. again demonstrated is the markedly abnormal appearance to its distal cervical portion with evidence of dissection with perceptible intimal flap, at roughly the level of the angle of the mandible, continuing to roughly the level of the c1 neural arch (3:160-184): the overall appearance is suggestive of persistent extensive dissection with partial thrombosis of the false lumen. the overall appearance of the more proximal cervical portion of the left ica is unremarkable, with no evidence of retrograde propagation of the dissection. the dmin of the left ica, just distal to the bulb is 7.5 mm, with the dmin at the more normal-appearing distal portion, at the level of the skull base, is 4.5 mm, with no flow-limiting proximal stenosis. there is an overall unremarkable appearance to the proximal right ica with a proximal dmin of 6.0 mm and distal dmin of 5 mm, with no flow-limiting stenosis. however, examination of the curved planar reformatted images demonstrates marked continuous mural irregularity throughout the distal portion of this vessel which, in context, raises the possibility of additional dissection. there may even be formation of small pseudoaneurysm at the level of the skull base (3:166-167). of note, there is a slight "corkscrew" configuration to both icas at the level of the skull base, which, itself, may be associated with a tendency to dissection (as seen in the collet-sicard syndrome). also noted is an abnormal appearance to the distal v2 segment of the right vertebral artery within the c3 right transverse foramen, which does not appear to be accounted for by opacification of the vertebral venous plexus. this includes the appearance of an intimal flap suggesting an additional short-segmental dissection (3:154-161, 400b:28, and curved reformations, ___:28,815). this vessel demonstrates otherwise normal caliber, contour, and opacification, as does the left vertebral artery, from its subclavian origin to the vertebrobasilar confluence. other than the abnormality involving the intracranial portion of the left internal carotid and that middle cerebral artery, the appearance of the intracranial circulation is within normal limits and unchanged. specifically, there is a normal appearance to the corresponding intracranial portion of the right ica and its major branches. robust anterior and smaller caliber left posterior communicating arteries are seen, with no aneurysm larger than 2 mm. as before, there is normal opacification of the principal dural venous sinuses and the deep cerebral veins.

corresponding to the location of a right level ii lesion as seen on preceding ultrasound, there is a rounded mass measuring 1.5 x 1 x 1 cm (cc x ap x trv) in size. this appears to be isoattenuating as compared to adjacent cervical lymph nodes, but appears more bulbous in contour. this is in the submandibular location on the right, but difficult to ascertain whether arising from the parotid tail or extrinsic to it. on the left in the same location, there is a smaller more elongated 1.1 x 0.6 cm normal appearing submandibular lymph node. additional smaller lymph nodes are also seen at the level ib, level ii and iii, without enlargement or abnormal morphology. nasopharyngeal, oropharyngea, and hypopharyngeal soft tissues are symmetric. the parenchyma of parotid and submandibular glands appears unremarkable. nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal soft tissues are symmetric. there is no focal thyroid lesion. vascular structures are patent. incidental note is made of aberrant right subclavian artery coursing posterior to the esophagus to cross the midline. a subpleural nodularity in the left posterior lung apex may be related to scarring.

within the limitations of a non-contrast study, no focal mass, abscesses or significant adenopathy is seen in the neck. the parotid, submandibular glands are unremarkable. moderate calcification is seen in both carotid bifurcations. a right ij central venous line ends at the level of the mid svc. minimal soft tissue induration is seen at the right ij central line. the endotracheal tube ends 3.5 cm above the carina. multiple small cervical lymph nodes measuring less than a centimeter are seen bilaterally. dependent consolidation involving bilateral upper lobes, is better assessed in the concurrent chest ct. an endotracheal tube is in place. there is pooling of secretions within the nasopharynx and minimally within the trachea.
the visualized elements of the posterior fossa and intracranial structures appear grossly normal. at the angle of the right mandible there is evidence of a prominent lymph node measuring approximately 17 x 15 mm in size with low attenuation. the previously noted left-sided enlarged lymph nodes have been decreased in size since the prior study. the airway is patent. in the interim, there is evidence of significant enlargement of the superior mediastinal mass producing splaying and deviation of the supra-aortic branches as well as the carina, the airway is patent. the esophagus appears dilated at the time of the examination. correlation with a dedicated ct of the chest is recommended.
there is severe atherosclerosis of the visualized aortic arch with irregular soft plaque (2: ___), along the anteroinferior portion of the arch. this contributes to mild narrowing of the great vessel origins. there is no anatomic variation of the aortic arch. the right common carotid artery has regions of mild luminal narrowing but no flow-limiting stenosis. the right internal carotid artery has mild narrowing at its origin, then focal moderate (50-60%% stenosis by european criteria 18 mm distal to the vessel origin, just before the vessel curves anteriorly approximately 90 degrees. a tiny focal outpouching noted laterally may relate to tiny focus of ulceration. ( se 2, im 177) the remaining cervical and visualized intracranial right internal carotid artery has regions of mild atherosclerotic irregularity but no other evidence of flow-limiting stenosis. the left common carotid artery has regions of mild atherosclerotic irregularity without the evidence of flow-limiting stenosis until its bifurcation. the left common carotid artery bifurcation has dense calcific plaque which mildly (20% luminal narrowing) narrows the left ica origin and moderately narrows the left eca origin. the remainder of the cervical and visualized intracranial left internal carotid artery is tortuous with a loop just proximal to the skull base, and has mild regions of atherosclerotic narrowing but no evidence of flow-limiting stenosis. calcification and contrast partially obscure the origins of both vertebral arteries. they are codominant. there is likely moderate stenosis of the right vertebral artery origin and at least mild stenosis of the left vertebral artery origin. the remainder of the vertebral arteries have mild atherosclerotic irregularity but no other evidence of flow-limiting stenosis. the examination is otherwise significant for marked degenerative changes of the cervical spine with high-grade spinal canal narrowing at at c4-c5 and c5-c6, and less severe narrowing at other levels; mild mediastinal adenopathy partially visualized; post-traumatic encephalomalacia of the right greater than left frontal and temporal lobes inferior/anterior aspects, partially visualized as well. there are areas of scarring in the lung apices with a tiny nodule in the left lung apex ( se 2, im 65); lungs are inadequately assessed on the present study.

comparison is made to head mr from ___ as well as a head ct from that same date.
the patient is status post fusion procedure, with fixation plate extending from the posterior aspect of the occiput to the c4 vertebra. the right c1 cerclage wire does not appear to encircle the arch of c1. no postoperative ct of the neck is available to determine if this represents a change in position. the left c1 cerclage wire encircles the left posterior arch of c1 and cerclage wires about the posterior elements of c2 are noted in symmetric position bilaterally. a left- sided c4 screw is located at the edge of the c3-4 facet and is not lodged in bone. the right c4 screw is seated within the lamina. there is persistent spinal stenosis from approximately c3 through c6, due to posterior spondylosis. there is thickening of the posterior nasopharyngeal mucosa and soft tissue thickening within the prevertebral tissues anterior to c3 and c4. no discrete fluid collection is identified within the retropharyngeal space. there are several small anterior and posterior cervical triangle lymph nodes, which are subcentimeter in size. the visualized portions of the lung apices appear unremarkable.

there is improvement in the caliber of the left cervical internal carotid artery, compared to the most recent study. however, there is still persistent mild narrowing over a long segment extending from the level of from the level of c1 to proximal internal carotid artery. bulbous appearance of the internal carotid artery, at its origin from the bifurcation of the common carotid artery is again noted and unchanged. the appearance of the right cervical internal carotid artery is unchanged with mild stenosis, noted in the cervical segment distally. the vertebral arteries on both sides are patent from their origin. the intracranial internal carotid arteries and the arteries of the posterior circulation not patent. mild degenerative changes and pleuro parenchymal scarring in the lung apices are again noted, incompletely evaluated.
post-tracheostomy status is noted. theere is extensive hypodensity and swelling of the soft tissues posterior and lateral to the trachea. this extends laterally into bilateral parapharyngeal spaces, and is in contact with bilateral common carotid arteries causing their lateral displacement. on the left side, the this material extends posterior to the left common carotid artery. there is associated loss of the fat planes in this region. there is anterior displacement and mild narrowing of the trachea superior to the level of the stoma. this may represent a fluid collection, perhaps an abscess, or indurated edematous soft tissue (series 5, image 43). some of this was present on the chest ct of ___, but the volume has increased greatly. structures of the nasopharynx and oropharynx appear normal. bilateral vocal cords are symmetrical. bilateral parotid and submandibular glands appear normal. the great vessels of the neck appear normal. a few subcentimeter level 2 lymph nodes are noted bilaterally. the visualized intracranial structures appear normal. visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. fibrotic scarring is noted in bilateral visualized lung apices. mild degenerative changes are noted in the cervical spine.
there is decreased mass effect in the region of the right submandibular gland when compared to the previous exam. there is abnormal contiguous with the submandibular gland. i cannot separate the gland from the adjacent hematoma, so that measurements cannot be obtained. there definitely is no increase in size of the hematoma. there are no definite new findings.
there is diffuse subcutaneous fat stranding in the submental region, with prominent submental nodes, the largest measuring 8 x 11 mm (2:44). however, the nodes enhance homogeneously, and there is no fluid collection seen. other shotty nodes are demonstrated: submandibular nodes measure up to 5 x 9 mm on the left (2:37) and 4 x 11 mm on the right (2:35); right jugulodigastric node measures 6 x 9 mm (2:38). while streak artifact from dental amalgam and posts limit evaluation of the oral cavity somewhat, where visualized, the ___- and oropharynx appear unremarkable. the parotid, submandibular, and thyroid glands appear normal. the major vessels of the neck are patent. the visualized posterior fossa appears unremarkable. the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated. the visualized lung apices are clear. punctate pleural calcification on the left is unchanged (2:85). degenerative changes are noted particularly at the c5-6 and c6-7 levels, where there is intervertebral disc space narrowing, and posterior discs and osteophytes cause moderate central canal narrowing and indentation of the ventral thecal sac.
a large, right sided, heterogeneous soft tissue density mass is identified, with the appearance of an expanded right parotid gland, (measuring up to 4 x 8 cm) and swelling of the right muscles of mastication. this mass extends superiorly to the level of the maxillary sinuses and inferiorly to the level of the mandible. there is extensive fat stranding adjacent to this mass in the subcutaneous tissues. there is swelling of the right lateral pharyngeal wall. there is mild enlargement of the right submandibular gland. no calciul are identified along the course of the right parotid duct. there is no osseous destruction. several small posterior cervical lymph nodes are identified, none of which are pathologically enlarged. the airway is patent. visualized lung apices are clear. the visualized portion of the brain is unremarkable.
there is soft tissue swelling in the left preauricular region extending down to the level of the hyoid bone. there is also marked thickening of the left pinna. the external auditory canal appears normal. there are fluid levels as well as opacification of the left mastoid air cells. although these may be related to prior intubation or supine positioning, infection cannot be excluded. there are no discrete fluid collections. the visualized orbits and brain appear normal. the left middle ear is clear. note is made of a tracheostomy, as well as an esophageal stent. the biapical consolidation with air bronchograms is stable from ___. within the right cervical region, there are asymmetric soft tissues, presumably related to asymmetric musculature related to positioning. no discrete fluid collection is seen.
there is a 4.2cm ap x 3.7cm transverse x 3.9cm cc enhancing soft tissue lesion centered at the right tongue base, involving the intrisnsic muscles of the tongue. the lesion is at but does not clearly cross the midline at the toongue base. there is extension of abnormal soft tissues superiorly which extends into the middle third of the tongue on the right, involves the floor of the mouth and is indistinct from the medial pterygoid muscle as well as the mylohyoid. the lesion involes the tonsillar pillars and the right side of the soft palate. the right parapharyngeal fat is partially effaced by this lesion. it abuts but does not encase the right internal carotid artery. the preepiglottic fat does not appear to be involved. nodularity of the thyroid gland is noted, which should be further evaluated with thyroid ultrasound if not already performed. the parotid glands and submandibular glands are unremarkable. there is no cervical adenopathy. the included intracranial contents are unremarkable. lenses have been replaced bilaterally. the visualized lung apices show mild scarring atelectasis and emphysematic changes. bilateral pleural effusions are noted. no suspicious osseous lesions.
the contrast timing on the current study is sub-optimal and good opacification is not seen of the arterial or venous vasculature. hence a vascular injury cannot be excluded. an mri/mra of the cervical spine is recommended for further evaluation. again seen is a fracture of the lamina of the c7 vertebrae, unchanged from prior study. there is anterior wedge deformity of the c7 with an osseous fragment at the anterior aspect of the c7 vertebral body, likely an acute fracture. ct is not able to provide intrathecal detail as compared to mr. there are multilevel degenerative joint changes, unchanged from prior as follows: at c3-c4, there is loss of disc height and endplate osteophyte formation. in addition, there is a moderate to severe right neural foraminal narrowing. at c4-c5, there is mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. at c6-c7, there is loss of disc height, endplate osteophyte formation, moderate narrowing of the spinal canal, moderate right neural foraminal narrowing.
the right common carotid artery is patent without significant stenoses from its origin to the carotid bulb. calcified plaque is present at the right carotid bulb. the right internal carotid artery is occluded from its origin to the level of the cavernous segment, where a small amount of contrast opacification is present. correlation with the preceding circle of ___ mra confirms that the flow in the cavernous segment is retrograde, likely from the left-sided anterior circulation. the right anterior cerebral and middle cerebral arteries are supplied through the anterior communicating artery, and they are smaller than the left anterior cerebral and middle cerebral arteries, likely due to restricted inflow. the right posterior communicating artery is small, unlikely to contribute any significant blood supply to the right anterior and middle cerebral arteries. the left common carotid and internal carotid arteries are patent without evidence of significant stenoses. no stenoses or aneurysms are identified in the left anterior cerebral or middle cerebral arteries. the right vertebral artery origin is poorly visualized due to artifact. otherwise, the right and left vertebral arteries are widely patent without evidence of stenoses. the basilar artery and the right and left posterior cerebral arteries are patent without evidence of significant stenoses or aneurysms. perforation of the nasal septum is noted. extensive ground-glass opacities are noted at the lung apices bilaterally, concordant with the interstitial opacities observed on preceding chest radiographs. mildly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, up to 14 mm, are likely reactive. the imaged bones appear unremarkable. a preliminary report of pneumonia, known to treating physicians, was provided by dr. ___ in the early morning of ___. additional preliminary report of right internal carotid artery occlusion from its origin till the cavernous region was provided by dr. ___ and dr. ___ later on ___.

again aortic dissection is visualized extending to the left subclavian artery and also to both common carotid arteries. again there is evidence of narrowing of the lumen in the proximal common carotid arteries which apparently is larger on the right side, in the interim, apparently the true lumen of both common carotids is slightly wider, however, filling defects remains evident. the reconstitution of the normal caliber of the carotids remains below the cervical bifurcations. there is no evidence of dissection involving the internal carotid arteries in the cervical course. the vertebral arteries appear normal. the ct of the head demonstrates no evidence of mass, mass effect, or large territorial infarction, however, the possibility of small ischemic changes cannot be completely excluded, mri of the head is recommended for further characterization. the bone structures and soft tissues appear unremarkable. mild mucosal thickening is noted on the maxillary sinuses likely consistent with mucous retention cysts.
as described in the preliminary report, there is a filling defect within the left internal jugular, external jugular, and jugular veins, consistent with thrombosis. the vein is expanded, and there is stranding surrounding it, all consistent with thrombosis. there is suggestion of filling defect within the sigmoid sinus, although it is also possible that this may represent some mixing artifact. the major branches of the circle of ___ are opacified. no aneurysms are appreciated. again noted is a hemorrhage in evolution within the left parieto-occipital region. detail within the brain parenchyma is limited by technique. degenerative changes are present within the cervical spine. no fracture is appreciated. the mastoid air cells are opacified bilaterally, but there is no evidence of bone destruction. there is mucosal thickening within the left sphenoid sinus. the right anterior ethmoid air cells are also opacified. left parotid gland calcifications are again incidentally noted. the orbits are grossly unremarkable. limited images of the lungs are degraded by respiratory artifact. multiplanar reformatted images redemonstrate the presence of a left internal, external, and common jugular vein thrombosis.
there is a 47 x 31 mm intraparenchymal hematoma within the left frontal lobe. the medial end of the hematoma abuts and appears to extend into the adjacent frontal ___ of the left lateral ventricle. there is hypodensity surrounding the intraparenchymal hematoma, most consistent with surrounding edema. there is approximately 4 mm of midline shift towards the right. in addition, there is another 5-mm focus of intraparenchymal hemorrhage adjacent to the larger hematoma in the left corona radiata. there is periventricular hypodensity, most likely consistent with sequelae of microvascular ischemia. there are no other lesions identified. the visualized paranasal sinuses are clear. there are no worrisome bone lesions identified.
within limitations of a noncontrast neck ct there is no evidence of mass or fluid collection within neck. evaluation of the areas aerodigestive surfaces are limited by placement of endotracheal tube. evaluation of the cervical lymph chains does not demonstrate too numerous or morphologically abnormal lymph nodes. the parotid, submandibular, sublingual, and thyroid glands are unremarkable in appearance. there are air-fluid levels in the sphenoid sinus which may be related to intubation. in the bilateral lung apices there are ground-glass opacities with heterogenous cystic changes which may be due to infection or post-radiation change. correlate with treatment history. the visualized portions of the brain do not show evidence of acute hemorrhage, masses, mass effect or infarct.
there is no evidence of abscess or abnormal enhancement within the neck. there are small lymph nodes, but none meeting criteria for enlargement. the pharynx and visualized airway are unremarkable. there is atherosclerotic disease of the aortic arch as seen on prior chest ct. there is extensive multilevel degenerative change of the cervical spine, most prominent at c3-4. there is moderate to severe canal narrowing from c3- c6.
no masses are identified in the neck and upper thorax. scattered small cervical lymph nodes are present, without abnormal enhancement, central necrosis, or calcification. severe calcific atherosclerosis and soft plaques are noted in the aortic arch and branch vessel origins, as well as the bilateral carotid bifurcations, without flow-limiting stenosis. the internal jugular veins are patent. the thyroid gland is atrophic and heterogeneous. severe centrilobular and paraseptal emphysema is present, with an 11-mm calcified granuloma or pleural plaque in the anterior left upper lobe. prominent nodes in the superior mediastinum measure up to 8 mm. these findings are better evaluated on subsequent ct torso. visualized intracranial structures are unremarkable. the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. there is moderate degenerative disease of the cervical spine, with multilevel anterior bridging osteophytes. multiple small posterior disc-osteophyte complexes are also present, with slight effacement of the thecal sac, most notable at c3-c4. please note that ct cannot visualize intrathecal detail. moderate to severe facet and uncovertebral joint hypertrophy are also present, right greater than left, with associated foraminal stenosis.
there are surgical clips in the left neck. the previously noted area of soft tissue asymmetry of the region of the left sternocleidomastoid and scalene muscles persists, but is thought to represent muscular asymmetry as opposed to a recurrent mass. this is supported by lack of fdg avidity on the prior pet scan. there is no evidence of new enhancing masses or pathological lymphadenopathy within the neck. the vascular structures, osseous structures, and the remainder of the soft tissues are normal. the left maxillary sinus remains partially opacified. there is a bleb within the right lung, which is incompletely imaged.
the soft tissues of the neck are symmetric without evidence of mass lesion or lymphadenopathy. the nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and parapharyngeal tissues are grossly unremarkable. the orbits and paranasal sinuses demonstrate no abnormalities. specifically, the vocal cords are symmetric as well as the piriform sinuses. the thyroid gland is unremarkable. the principal vascular structures of the neck are patent. there is collapse of the left upper lobe. there is extensive bullous disease noted in both included lung apices. there is also a linear scar-like opacity in the right upper lobe. the reader is referred to the chest ct report of the same date for full description of these findings. the left subclavian artery is occluded just distal to its origin from the aortic arch. the subclavian artery reconstitutes at the origin of the left vertebral artery. these findings are consistent with subclavian steal syndrome.
there is significant streak artifact from dental amalgam that limits evaluation of the tonsils. the visualized tonsils are mildly enlarged. there are small foci of air; however, there is no hypodensity suggestive of fluid collection or abscess in the tonsils. the frayed appearing thickening of the supraglottic oropharynx is again seen on the left with a mild degree of enhancement. there are prominent bilateral reactive cervical lymph nodes. the anterior esophagus again appears patulous. there are bilateral pleural effusions with the left-sided effusion greater since prior exam. multifocal ground-glass opacities are again seen within the lungs. there are multiple prominent mediastinal and paratracheal lymph nodes which appear unchanged since dedicated lung cta on ___.
overall, evaluation of the base of the tongue and vallecula region is limited by streak artifact related to dental hardware. fat stranding of the subcutaneous and deep soft tissues of the neck are consistent with radiation exposure, as is concentric soft tissue thickening around the supraglottic larynx, associated with luminal irregularity. submucosal hypervascularity and enhancement extends from the base of the tongue along the hypopharynx and supraglottic larynx bilaterally, however, no definite active source of hemorrhage is identified. arterial structures within the neck, including the bilateral carotid systems are patent. an approximately 21 mm heterogeneously hypodense left thyroid nodule persists. lung apices demonstrate mild paraseptal emphysematous changes. scattered lymph nodes are seen within the neck without lymphadenopathy. bone windows again reveal multilevel cervical spondylosis, as described in ___ with the most severe disc height loss at c5/6 and c6/7. as noted on prior, disc osteophyte complex appears most prominent at these levels as well.
the patient is intubated with the endotracheal tube ending imaged ending approximately 4 cm above the carina. again seen within the mid to lower trachea is narrowing which is similar in appearance over multiple prior studies. however, this is incompletely evaluated on this study and on the prior ct trachea study of ___, this also could not be adequately evaluated due to patient's inability to follow instructions. no obstructing mass is identified. multiple small cervical lymph nodes do not meet ct criteria for pathologic enlargement. a small amount of fluid is noted within the nasopharynx, likely from intubation. the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. visualized lung apices demonstrate consolidation at the superior aspect of the right lower lobe.
the known c1 and c2 fracture is better characterized on the prior ct c-spine study. the origins of the arch vessels are patent. atherosclerotic calcified and noncalcified plaques are noted at the origins of the arch vessels and in the aortic arch imaged. the common carotid arteries are patent, and tortuous in course. there is minimal narrowing of the left common carotid artery proximally. mixed calcified and noncalcified plaques are noted at the (a) left common carotid bifurcation extending into proximal cervical internal carotid artery over a length of 1.6cm, minimal lumen of 1.7 millimeter and (b) right common carotid bifurcation, extending into the right proximal cervical internal carotid artery over an approximate length of 2.2cm, , with minimal lumen of 2 mm. assessment is somewhat limited due to the artifacts from the adjacent calcifications. there is no flow limitation distally. calcifications are also noted in the petrous and cavernous carotid segments, without flow limitation. intracranial arteries are not completely included on the present study. the origins of the vertebral arteries are patent on both sides. there is mild narrowing of the right vertebral artery at its origin. the vertebral arteries appear to be codominant and patent throughout their course. minimal calcifications are noted in the v4 segments. no flow limitation is noted distally. the vertebral arteries appear patent at the level of the c1 and c2 fractures. there is mild-moderate narrowing of the left vertebral artery at c5/6 level from adjacent osteophytes and tortuous course. multilevel, multifactorial degenerative changes are noted in the cervical spine with moderate-severe foraminal narrowing with facet changes. emphysematous changes are noted in both lungs. aerosolized secretions are noted in trachea.

the origins of great vessels are patent. there is minimal focal narrowing of the origin of both proximal ica from atheromatous plaque. the left proximal ica measures 5 mm, and the left distal ica measures 5.5 mm in luminal diameter. the right proximal ica measures 6 mm, and the distal right ica measures 5 mm. there is no hemodynamically significant flow limiting stenosis or evidence of dissection. both vertebral arteries are patent. degenerative changes are demonstrated in the cervical spine, most marked at c4-5 and c5-6 levels. there is apparent fusion of c5-6. severe canal narrowing from posterior vertebral osteophytes is demonstrated at c4-5 and c5-6 levels.
this study is severely limited due to lack of intravenous contrast and patient positioning. prevertebral soft tissue swelling appears to be present, greatest at c2-c3, measuring up to 1.7 cm. findings are likely attributable to prevertebral edema rather than a distinct organized fluid collection, but again assessment is limited. otherwise, the airway appears grossly patent. the epiglottis appears normal. extensive spondyloarthropathy changes are visualized throughout the cervical spine with endplate irregularity, severe disc space narrowing and obliteration with osseous fusion at c4-c5, c5-c6, and c6-c7. anterior loss of height of c7 appears chronic. scattered atherosclerotic calcifications are noted within the carotid arteries and distal vertebral arteries. visualized aspect of the brain demonstrates age-appropriate atrophy. bilateral lung apices demonstrate partially imaged pleural effusions. additionally, there are biapical ground-glass opacities as well as interlobular septal thickening likely reflecting pulmonary edema.
there is air within the subcutaneous tissues at the site of the anastomosis, more than expected for postoperative day 8. this may represent a leak from the anastomotic site. a nasogastric tube is seen in the lumen of the anastomosis, with the tip beyond the scope of this study. there is no large fluid collection. there is a drain in place at the site of anastomosis. there is an endotracheal tube in place with its tip in the trachea at the level of the upper sternum. there is a catheter seen in the left subclavian vein going into the superior vena cava with its tip out of the imaged portion of this study. the visualized brain parenchyma is grossly unremarkable. the salivary glands are unremarkable. there are no exophytic mucosal masses. there are aortic calcifications and bilateral carotid artery calcifications. there is a hypodensity in the right lobe of the thyroid gland that likely represents a thyroid nodule.
within the right supraclavicular region, there are two lymph nodes, which measure 12 x 7 mm, and 8 x 11 mm, respectively. in addition, just superior to this level, there is a suggestion of ill-defined increased soft tissue density about the right scalene muscle. there are several small bilateral jugulodigastric nodes, including a right- sided jugulodigastric node which measures 3 mm in short axis diameter. the thyroid gland appears unremarkable. the airways are patent. the visualized portions of the lung apices appear unremarkable. bone windows demonstrate no evidence of suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions. there is a rounded soft tissue density within the left maxillary sinus consistent with mucous retention cyst versus polyp, and fluid within the sphenoid sinuses.
again noted is the hangman's fracture, bipedicular at c2 level. there is also mild anterior atlantoaxial subluxation. there appears to be slight impingement on the right vertebral artery at the level of the fractured transverse foramina at c2. this could be due to intimal injury. however, there is no evidence of hematoma or frank dissection at this stage. some irregularity of the left vertebral artery contour is also noted at the level of the fracture which again could be due to intimal injury. no obvious hematoma. the rest of the vertebral arteries are unremarkable. the appearance is best seen on the orthogonal reconstructions series 104b, image 72, image 69. bilateral cca, eca (extracranial) are normal in caliber and patent. the thyroid has an unusual appearance, enlarged and heterogeneous, which could be due to a hematoma/thyroid disease. the fat planes in the muscles in the neck are unremarkable.
there is no soft tissue swelling apparent on ct examination. the bilateral parotid glands have a higher density than omral, which is a nonspecific finding. there are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes seen. limited views of the brain and lungs demonstrate no abnormalities. there is evidence of a prior sternotomy with sternal wires present. there are degenerative changes in the c6/7 vertebrae. the osseous structures are otherwise unremarkable.
the previously seen necrotic right level 2 node is no longer present. several small lymph nodes are scattered throughout the neck, with no pathologically enlarged nodes. there is persistent asymmetry of the oropharynx and hypopharynx on the right with amorphous enhancing soft tissue. there is a progressive nodular component which extends medially to contact the uvula and the lesion does appear contiguous with the soft palate and tongue base. it is difficult to discern any discrete mass. fascial planes throughout the neck are otherwise well preserved. there is no abnormal enhancement. there is spiculated consolidation within the left upper lobe, better evaluated on the chest ct performed on this date and reported separately. there are no destructive osseous lesions. partially visualized is an enhancing lesion within the right temporal lobe with surrounding hypoattenuation throughout the right temporal and parietal white matter as well as a ventriculostomy catheter, better evaluated on the recent brain mri. there are bilateral breast prostheses.
there is an obliquely oriented 1.2 cm linear hyperdensity within the esophagus and at the level of the cricoid cartilage consistent with a retained foreign body in the esophagus. no pneumomediastinum is noted within the upper chest. surgical clips are again noted in the thyroid bed presumably related to prior thyroid resection. small nodes are noted in both sides of neck, not significantly enlarged by ct size criteria. the visualized portion of the lung apices, intracranial contents and osseus structures are unremarkable.
due to the timing of the contrast bolus, the majority of contrast is present within the pulmonary arterial circulation, with minimal opacification of the cervical arteries. there is a normal three-vessel aortic arch. within the limitation above, the common carotid arteries are patent. there is mild atherosclerosis at the carotid bifurcations bilaterally. secondary to artifact from the dental material, evaluation of the mid-cervical portions of the internal carotid arteries is severely limited, and images are essentially nondiagnostic. the vertebral artery origins are patent. there is tortuosity of the left vertebral artery at the level of the c2 fracture. there are two sites which, in this setting, are concerning for the possibility of acute vertebral artery injury (2:183, 2:180, as well as 2:191), though the vessel appears to remain patent throughout its course. flow within the v3 and v4 segments is present, though markedly attenuated, which may be on a congenital or posttraumatic basis. there is an unchanged appearance of the type ___ fracture of the base of the dens, and left body and lateral mass of c2, extending into the transverse foramen. there is a large curvilinear soft tissue structure within the anterior epidural space resulting in moderate canal narrowing which most likely represents a central disc herniation, with a similar, but slightly smaller left paracentral herniation at c4-5. there are both endotracheal and nasogastric tubes in place. the endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 15 mm superior to the carina. there is dependent lung consolidation.
the study is significantly limited due to the lack of iv contrast for assessment of inflammatory/infectious changes/focal space-occupying lesions. within this limitation, the following are the findings. there is fullness/prominence of the palatine tonsils on both sides, left more than right. the parapharyngeal space fat has slightly increased attenuation, with lack of clear demarcation on some images, adjacent to the submandibular glands for example. in addition, there is thickening of the aryepiglottic folds with fullness in the left pyriform sinus, resulting in marked narrowing of the larynx. there may be possible continuity of the inflammatory changes in the palatine tonsil/parapharyngeal space and the laryngeal mucosal thickening related changes.however, this is inadequately assessed on the present study due to lack of post-contrast images. there is also mildly increased attenuation in the subcutaneous soft tissues of the neck on both sides submandibular region (series 3, image 42). there are multiple small nodes, noted in both sides of the neck, some of which are borderline in size. degenerative changes are noted in the endplates at c5-6 level. these are inadequately assessed on the present study. small lucent focus is noted in the clivus, which is inadequately assessed on the present study. there is mild mucosal thickening in the maxillary sinuses and mild-to-moderate in the ethmoid air cells on both sides. thyroid is normal in size. the imaged lung apices reveal areas of increased attenuation in the lungs bil., which are inadequately assessed on the present studyplease see the detailed report on the concurrent ct chest study.

there is minimal bilateral calcified plaque at the carotid bifurcations. there is no flow-limiting stenosis. the minimal diameter of the proximal right ica (at the bifurcation) measures 8 mm. the diameter of the distal right ica measures 4.5 mm. the diameter of the proximal left ica (at the bifurcation) measures 6.5 mm and at the distal left ica measures 4.5 mm. the vertebral arteries are patent bilaterally. small amount of calcified plaque just adjacent to the origin of the left vertebral artery is noted, although there is no evidence of stenosis. the visualized portions of the lung apices demonstrate areas of airtrapping, likely due to expiratory phase of imaging. there is asymmetry to the valleculae, left smaller than the right, which is likely due to retained secretions within. multilevel degenerative changes of the cervical spine are noted including disc space narrowing and posterior osteophytes, most severe at c5-c6 and c6-c7 with severe right neural foraminal narrowing and mild to moderate canal narrowing at c6-7.
there is no evidence of significant internal carotid artery stenosis. there is mild irregularity of the origin of the left internal carotid artery. there is no evidence of pseudoaneurysm at the level of the skull base. the vertebral arteries are dimminutive in size. there is discontinuity of the right vertebral artery at the level of the fracture involving c1 and there is mild narrowing of the left vertebral artery at the same location. the vertebral artery origins are not evaluated on this study which is concentrated on the upper portion of the neck and skull base. there are bilateral fetal type posterior communicating arteries supplying the posterior cerebral arteries and the upper basilar artery.

since ___, there has been further progression with now no flow demonstrated within the entire right internal carotid artery beginning at its origin. the left carotid artery remains patent with no evidence of stenosis, dissection or aneurysm formation. distal left internal carotid artery measures 4.0 mm. both vertebral arteries demonstrate a relative narrowing at their origins from the subclavian, right slightly greater than left, compatible with proximal stenosis. there is no evidence of vertebral artery dissection or aneurysm. the visualized lung apices are clear. the airways are patent. the visualized soft tissues of the neck are unremarkable. partially imaged more distally, there is reconstitution of the right distal internal carotid artery in its cavernous segment, believed to be anterograde from collateralization from the subclavian artery. there has been interval increase in size of now very prominent right-sided lenticulostriate branches since ___, which either could be related to luxury hyperperfusion or early collateralization. the known dural-based mass centered at the right petroclival junction, which demonstrates hyperenhancement and extension into the right cavernous sinus is unchanged and the differential remains the same, likely representing a meningioma. there are known areas of infarction as better depicted on concurrent mri.
no comparisons are available. there is a right internal jugular vein central line whose tip is not imaged but is seen extending into the svc. no central lines are seen within the left neck. in the left jugulodigastric region, there is a small focus of enhancement which measures 8 x 7 mm, located anterolateral to the left common carotid artery and anterior to the left internal jugular vein. there is a small projection off of the internal jugular vein which is running near this lesion. if there is a history of recent attempted instrumentation of the left neck, this may represent a small hematoma most likely arising from the internal jugular vein or its branches. if there is no recent history of instrumentation, this may represent small lymph node. of note, there is plane of fat surrounding this enhancing focus. there is enlargement and increased density of the left parotid gland with asymmetric extension inferiorly down to the level of the left submandibular gland. there is also thickening of the adjacent platysma muscle and stranding and thickening of the subcutaneous fat. this stranding of the fat is separated from the previously described focus of enhancement. the above findings likely represent parotiditis and inflammation of the adjacent soft tissues. the distal common carotid arteries and the proximal internal carotid arteries bilaterally appear patulous which most likely represent post-surgical change. there is no evidence of aneurysm, pseudoaneurysm, dissection, or active arterial extravasation. calcifications of the cavernous internal carotid arteries are seen. there are also calcifications of the right vertebral artery and the right internal carotid artery just proximal to the skull base. dense arterial calcifications of the aortic arch and the origins of the great vessels were also noted. a small right pleural effusion is noted. there may be a smaller left pleural effusion. partially visualized is inter- and intralobular septal thickening of both lungs as well as some scattered areas of ground-glass opacities. please refer to the recent chest ct from ___ for full description of findings. degenerative changes of the cervical spine are seen without high-grade canal or neural foraminal narrowing. there is a polypoid lesion of the left maxillary sinus, which likely represents retention cyst. septations of the inferior portions of the maxillary sinuses are seen bilaterally.

comparison is made to a prior cta neck of ___ and ct torso of ___. mild asymmetry involving the left tonsillar pillar does not appear changed from prior exam with a small punctate tonsillolith noted within it. no mucosal/submucosal abnormalities are noted within the nasopharynx or oropharynx. the tongue base is unremarkable. no pathologically enlarged cervical lymph nodes are identified bilaterally. the parapharyngeal fat pad is preserved. no retropharyngeal nodes are present. the true/false vocal cords appear normal. no thyroid gland abnormalities are noted. the orbits are normal. large retention cysts are noted within the right maxillary sinus. the remaining paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells appear well pneumatized. mild multilevel degenerative changes are noted within the cervical spine with anterior osteophytes and loss of disc space height, most marked at the c4-c5 interspace and c5-c6 interspace. small osteophyte is also noted at the c6-c7 interspace. thyroid gland appears somewhat atrophic. there is stable appearance to known occluded right common carotid artery. post-surgical changes from prior median sternotomy are noted. included portions of the lung apices display known underlying centrilobular emphysema.
there is calcified hard and soft plaque in the aortic arch. a small amount of plaque extends into the left subclavian artery. the left carotid artery is highly abnormal. at the carotid bulb, there is significant soft and hard plaque. the lumen of the proximal-most left internal carotid artery, over a 2.5 cm-long segment, is barely visible as a "string sign," but not completely occluded. the maximum diameter of the lumen in this segment is 1 mm (2,55). distal to this very stenotic segment, there is extensive diffuse atherosclerosis in the remaining internal carotid artery to the level of the skull base and into the intracranial portion, to the level of the carotid siphon. the minimal diameter of the distal segment is 2.0 mm. the strict nascet criteria cannot be applied due to the severe diffuse disease of this vessel. the estimated stenosis in the proximal ica is likely 95-99%. the right common carotid artery is patent. there is both hard and soft plaque at the bifurcation as well, to a lesser extent in comparison to the left. the minimal diameter of the proximal internal carotid artery is 2.5 mm. the minimal diameter of the distal internal carotid artery is 5.0 mm. this suggests a 50% stenosis in the proximal portion. there is no tandem stenosis. shallow calcified plaque is present in the carotid siphon, but there is no flow-limiting stenosis. the vertebral arteries are patent without evidence of flow-limiting stenosis. there is slight narrowing at the origin of the right vertebral artery with some distal tapering in its v4 segment. the airway is patent. there is centrilobular emphysema and mild pleural thickening of the apices. prominent mediastinal lymph nodes are present, with the largest, in the aortopulmonary window, measuring 10 mm (2,29). these are better evaluated on the concurrent cta of the chest. the thyroid gland is unremarkable. there are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the neck. the salivary and parotid glands are normal without mass or evidence of inflammation. the visualized paranasal sinuses are clear. degenerative changes at the spine are present, most significant at the c5-6 level. there is no fracture or malalignment. no significant neural foraminal or spinal canal narrowing is present.
there is a comminuted fracture of the body of c2 with 4-mm anterior displacement of one of the fragments. the fracture line extends into the left foramen transversarium. on the sagittal views, particularly, the suggestion that there is a non-displaced fracture of the left lateral mass of c1 in addition. the left vertebral artery appears diminutive from its origin, but contrast is not visualized within its lumen starting at the distal aspect of the c3 vertebral body, and continuing superiorly to the level of the dens, at which point there is reconstitution of opacificationof the artery, though it remains diminutive compared to the contralateral side. the right vertebral artery demonstrates atherosclerotic calcification at its origin and within the v1 segment, none of which appears hemodynamically significant. the caliber, course, and opacification of the artery appears normal until the mid v4 segment, at which point there is atherosclerotic calcification, but centrally there appears to be a partially occlusive filling defect(4:217). the left common carotid artery and internal carotid artery are normal in caliber. there is non-hemodynamically significant atherosclerotic calcification of the cavernous and petrous internal carotid artery, at the carotid bulb, and in the mid portion of the common carotid artery. the right common carotid artery and internal carotid artery are also free of flow-limiting stenosis, there is atherosclerotic calcification of the cavernous right ica, the right carotid bulb, and minimally at the takeoff of the right common carotid artery. though this study was not designed for the full evaluation of the intracranial arteries, the proximal arteries within the circle of ___ appear free of hemodynamically significant stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm. in the visualized brain, there is no definite territorial infarct. there is prominence of the retrocerebellar csf space, which may reflect ___ ___ cisterna magna versus possibly an arachnoid cyst. the paranasal sinuses are clear, as are the mastoid air cells. there is no cervical lymphadenopathy. a right internal jugular central venous catheter is noted with its tip extending into the superior vena cava. within the visualized lungs, note is made of a calcified granuloma in the right lower lobe superior segment as well as some dependent changes. there are some secretions layering within the dependent portion of the trachea as well as along the left tracheal wall. asymmetry of the left piriform sinus, correlate with direct ent examination. apart from the fractures described in the cervical spine, there is multilevel cervical spondylosis with posterior osteophytes at c3-c4, c5-c6, and c6-c7. there is prevertebral soft tissue swelling in the area of the fracture. the patient is edentulous.
please refer to the accompanying ct c-spine report for a full description of the c-spine fracture. briefly, there has been interval displacement of a portion of the lateral body of the c2 vertebral body with complete lateral displacement of the vertebral foramina relative to the c3 vertebral foramina. at this level, there is disruption of the left vertebral artery with no definite discernable lumen extending over a distance of approximately 1.5 cm (2:138-141). this finding is substantiated on curved and volume rendered reformations and is most consistent with focal dissection. no extravasation of contrast is evident. distal reconstitution of the vertebral artery may be secondary to retrograde flow from the contralateral side. there is severe narrowing of the origin of the left vertebral body at its takeoff of the subclavian artery. moderate narrowing at the origin of the right vertebral artery which is otherwise patent to the level of the basilar artery is additionally evident. although there is no focal narrowing involving the right common and internal carotid arteries, segmental plaque is evident at the carotid bulb, and involving the intracranial/cavernous portions of the internal carotid artery. on the source images, there are several axial images which do not demonstrate any flow within the internal carotid artery just beyond the level of the carotid bulge which demonstrates moderate calcification. the internal carotid artery appears to reconstitute as a very thin lumen measuring approximately 2 mm in diameter. the caliber of the intracranial component of the ica measures approximately 3 cm but again is relatively narrowed compared to the contralateral side. narrowing of the supraclinoid area focally of the left ica down to 2 mm is noted. there is relative decrease in caliber of the left mca compared to the contralateral side. note is made of bilateral calcifications involving the cavernous portions of the icas. the visualized portions of the circle of ___ are otherwise unremarkable. the imaged portions of the inferior cranium appear intact without evidence for focal acute insults. note is made of prominent biapical septal thickening which may suggest an element of volume overload. there is partial opacification involving the ethmoid air cells anteriorly bilaterally. trace amount of mucosal thickening is noted within the sphenoid sinus on the left. the maxillary sinuses are clear.
there are no areas of aneurysmal dilatation, stenosis, or dissection involving the right or left carotid or vertebral arteries. no significant atherosclerotic disease is noted. the patient is status post endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube placement. there is opacification of the ethmoid sinuses. an air-fluid level is noted within the right maxillary sinus. mucosal thickening is noted within the left maxillary sinus. partially imaged sphenoid sinus demonstrates mucosal thickening as well. the mastoid air cells appear well aerated. biapical atelectasis is noted at the lung apices, left greater than right. bone windows demonstrate multilevel degenerative changes involving the cervical spine, worst at the c5-c6 level. 6.8-mm heterogeneus focus within the right lobe of the thyroid gland likely represents a thyroid nodule. a dedicated thyroid ultrasound examination could be performed to further evaluation this finding as clinically indicated on a nonemergent basis.
there is a heterogeneously enhancing 6.7 (ap) x 4.8 (trv) x 6.6 (cc) cm mass located within the right anterior cervical triangle. the right internal jugular vein does not enhance in this region which may reflect invasion, further confirmed, given the long filling defect extending in the right jugular vein extending inferior to the level of the right brachiocephalic vein. the filling defect does not appear to enter into the right brachiocephalic vein. no filling defect is visualized in the superior vena cava. the right internal jugular vein just superior to the mass also demonstrates a small filling defect reflecting invasion or thrombus. venous collaterals are seen. a large amount of scattered lymph nodes are seen throughout the bilateral anterior triangle, the largest in the right jugulodigastric region measuring 1.9 mm. otherwise, there are scattered, right greater than left, subcentimeter lymph nodes seen bilaterally. there is a large amount of soft tissue stranding surrounding the right cervical mass, particularly along its anterior and inferior border. there is no evidence for an enhancing fluid collection to suggest abscess. this mass extends from the angle of the mandible to the right supraclavicular region. this mass closely abuts the right common and external and internal carotid arteries with no evidence for circumferential soft tissue surrounding this. the mass appears to partially surround the lateral aspect of the right thyroid gland which may reflect close abutment versus a small amount of invasion. this mass closely abuts superiorly the right submandibular gland as well as appears to invade the right sternocleidomastoid muscle. there is abnormal soft tissue density and reticulation between the mass and the inferior parotid and the parotid tail concerning for infiltration or inflammatory change. there is enlargement of the bilateral tonsils. there is obliteration of the right vallecula with asymmetric prominent soft tissue measuring 1.0 x 1.0 cm (series 4, image 26). there is a small amount of calcification involving the left tonsillar bed. no osseous lytic or blastic lesions are identified. the visualized portions of the posterior fossa are unremarkable. the visualized portions of the upper lung parenchyma demonstrates centrilobular emphysema.
there has been no significant change in size or appearance of the large irregularly shaped mass in the right submandibular region, with peripherally enhancing multilocular appearance. the trachea remains deviated to the left, however airway is patent due to presence of a tracheostomy. an air-fluid level has developed in the sphenoid sinus in the interval. the right maxillary sinus is opacified. opacification of the mastoid air cells is seen bilaterally. there are enlarged superior mediastinal lymph nodes, measuring up to 12 mm in short-axis diameter. the internal and external jugular veins remain occluded, and appear expanded with thrombus. the left brachiocephalic and superior vena cava opacify with contrast. significant inflammatory changes surrounding the mass are again noted. rim-enhancing areas are again noted adjacent to the right sternocleidomastoid muscle, which appears thickened. nasogastric tube is in place. bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis are seen, with scattered areas of more focal opacities, which may be due to atelectasis, presence of infection cannot be entirely excluded. there are multilevel degenerative changes noted in the cervical spine, with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligaments as well as posterior spondylosis, significantly narrowing spinal canal on multiple levels, but most severe at c3-4 level, where spinal canal measures 4 mm ap dimension. there is partial fusion of c3 and 4 vertebral bodies, likely due to a degenerative process. the base of the tongue is not well evaluated due to severe streak artifact. the right internal and external carotid arteries are narrowed due to surrounding mass but are patent.
there is no significant change in the size and appearance of the ill-defined enhancement in the left parotid. there appear to be changes from a partial left parotidectomy. previously noted left thyroid nodule has resolved to a large extent. there is no pathologic neck adenopathy. no exophytic mucosal mass is seen. there is intracranial vascular calcification. right pulmonary nodule has decreased in size.
note is made of an endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and a left subclavian central venous catheter. the soft tissues of the neck appear unremarkable. there is no drainable fluid collection, pathologically enlarged lymph nodes, or other mass. the airway demonstrates no significant narrowing, although the study is limited by the presence of the endotracheal tube. the vocal cords do not appear markedly swollen. the lung apices demonstrate minimal scarring. the paranasal sinuses demonstrate mucosal thickening in multiple ethmoid air cells as well as the right maxillary sinus, likely related at least in part to the intubation.
there is occlusion of the left common carotid artery within the upper mediastinum. the right common carotid, internal anad external carotid branches, and jugular veins appear patent. the soft tissues of the neck are symmetric. there is no evidence of fluid collections within the neck to suggest hemorrhage. please see the ct c-spine report for discussion of the osseous structures. an et tube and ng tube are present.
as indicated by the history, there is a large goiter. the inferior extent of this enlarged thyroid is at the level of the aortic arch. there is a component of the mass which lies posteromedial to the brachiocephalic veins and superior vena cava, which are flattened, but not occluded. the inferior aspect of the mass is bilobed with a right superior mediastinal component and a larger central and left paracentral component which fills the anterior superior mediastinum. the mediastinal mass is continuous with a markedly enlarged left thyroid lobe which is roughly 8 cm in transverse dimension. the mass also extends posterior to the trachea, flattening the esophagus and indenting the posterior aspect of the airway. the airway is markedly displaced to the right and narrowed. the right lobe of the thyroid gland is still definable and has heterogeneous enhancement, as does the remaining enlarged portion of the gland. the larynx is anteriorly displaced. the mass extends throughout the left neck, to the level of the submandibular space. the oropharynx is also displaced to the right. the oropharyngeal airway is not narrowed. there are a few prominent lymph nodes identified in the anterior mediastinum, the largest is roughly 1.5 cm in transverse dimension and is in the right paratracheal space. small lymph nodes are seen in the neck, but no adenopathy is appreciated. the nasopharyngeal soft tissues, superior parapharyngeal spaces and skull base have a normal appearance. the mastoids and middle ears are normally aerated. no bony lytic or destructive changes are observed. there is pulmonary emphysema and bullous change evident in the superior aspects of the lungs.
correlation is made to carotid ultrasound series of ___. again seen is a large left-sided neck mass adjacent to the left carotid artery. surgical clips are seen surrounding this area. no fluid collections are seen, and there is no gas within this aneurysm. the fat planes around it are preserved. the thyroid gland is diffusely enlarged, with widening of the isthmus and focal increase in size of the left lobe with retrotracheal extent. calcifications are seen within this area. the thyroid gland extends caudally sternal notch, but not below it. calcification is seen within the aortic arch. please note that this is a limited exam secondary to the patient's inability to receive intravenous contrast material.
the study is extremely limited by patient positioning and extensive artifact from dental implants. within this limitation, no superficial or deep cervical abscess is identified. the airways are patent. small bilateral level 2a cervical lymph nodes do not meet ct criteria for significant adenopathy, measuring less than 8 mm in short axis. the submandibular and parotid glands are normal. the thyroid gland is normal. the imaged lung apices demonstrate minimal opacity in the dependent right upper lobe, which could represent atelectasis or a small focus of infection. the aortic arch and major branch vessels are normal. the cervical portions of the carotid arteries are normal. there is narrowing and lack of opacification of the lower half of the left internal jugular vein, consistent with chronic left internal jugular vein thrombosis. the right ij vein is normal. no focal osseous lesion is identified.
no contrast extravasation or tracheal-arterial communication seen. the visualized intracranial structures demonstrate prominent ventricles and sulci, out of proportion for the patient's age, possibly indicating cortical volume loss. normal enhancement is demonstrated in the major vascular intracranial structures. there is no evidence of lymphadenopathy. the airway appears patent with tracheostomy in place, pool of secretions is noted above the tracheostomy. severe emphysema. large left pleural effusion as seen on ___ examination. decreased right pleural effusion. persistent 3.1 x 2.2 cm right apical mass (4:92) may reflect focal atelectasis, fluid, or infection and is completely new since on ___, making neoplasm less likely. a new 11 x 13 mm right upper lobe lesion has same characteristics and differential (4:98). dense atherosclerotic calcifications are visualized in the carotid bifurcations, causing narrowing, correlation with carotid ultrasound is recommended for further characterization. the bony structures demonstrate multilevel degenerative changes consistent with anterior and posterior spondylosis, causing neural foraminal narrowing and anterior thecal sac deformity from c3/c4 through c7/t1. anterior teardrop fracture at t1 level and and anterolisthesis at c7 upon t1, of uncertain chronicity, please correlate clinically. there is no evidence of bone fragment within the cervical or thoracic spinal canal. aerosolized secretions are visualized in the sphenoid sinus.
non-contrast head ct: there is no ct evidence for acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, edema, or hydrocephalus. there is preservation of ___-white matter differentiation. the ventricles, basal cisterns and sulci are normal in sizes and configuration. no concerning bone abnormality is detected. there is mild mucosal thickening in the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses, and a mucus retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus. ct perfusion: symmetric cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume and mean transit time are demonstrated. cta neck: there is a bovine arch. the cervical carotid arteries and vertebral arteries are patent without hemodynamically significant stenoses. the right distal internal carotid artery measures 4.0 mm and the left distal internal carotid artery measures 4.2 mm in diameter. note is made of prominent adenoids and palatine tonsils bilaterally. the visualized lung apices appear clear. the thyroid is homogeneous in attenuation. cta head: the intracranial internal carotid and vertebral arteries are patent without evidence of hemodynamically significant stenoses or aneurysms.
there is a diffuse large volume of adventitious gas, some in large collections, throughout the soft tissues of the neck with extensive subcutaneous emphysema, as before. by report, patient has recently had a video swallow with oral conray contrast, and there is now contrast in several of these locules. hyperdense contrast material coating the oral cavity and layering in the oro- and hypopharynx is residual contrast. extraluminal contrast is noted in a thin tract connecting the left lateral aspect of the esophagus (2:30) to the surrounding soft tissues, implying a tear in the aerodigestive tract, presumably the cervical esophagus at this site. extraluminal contrast is accumulated in the neck, with the largest collection along the tracheoesophageal groove to the left, centered at the level of the hyoid bone. there is associated mass effect secondary with left lateral displacement of the entire left carotid space, including that carotid vessel, which appears intact. in addition, there is marked rightward deviation of the trachea and esophagus. contiguous with these collections of extraluminal contrast and gas is diffuse nonspecific soft tissue density material. no discrete rim enhancement is seen around these collections, but extensive phlegmonous collection is certainly a consideration. no contrast is seen below the level of the vocal cords, with no specific evidence of aspiration or tracheal injury, and no communication to indicate tracheo-esophageal fistula. regional vascular structures opacify normally. multiple bilateral pulmonary opacities as well as pleural effusions are better characterized on the concurrent chest ct (dictated separately). limited visualized portions of the mastoid air cells and paranasal sinuses are unremarkable, as are the caudal aspects of the brain.
contrast was not utilized since no iv access was available. noncontrast ct of the neck shows no definite evidence of mass or adenopathy. the left jugulodigastric node is slightly prominent but within the overall limits of normal for size. a left-sided picc line is noted.
the patient is status post extubation. previously noted lobulated soft tissue swelling in the supraglottic region is not identified in the present scan. oropharynx and hypopharynx are patent and symmetric. no significant lymphadenopathy. note is made of cervical spondylosis, as noted previously. the visualized portions of the lung apices are clear. no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
the exam is limited due to the lack of iv contrast. there is diffuse stranding in the muscles with loss of the normal fat planes in the neck, right greater than left, which is a change from most recent exam. no focal fluid collection is identified. the heterogeneous appearance with areas of focal fat in the parotid gland is similar to prior study. the calcified lymph nodes in the bilateral jugular chains as well as submandibular on the left are consistent with history of prior treated submental tuberculous abscess. there are scattered nodes, without pathologic enlargement. there is is mild scarring at the lung apices.
full evaluation of the mandibular and maxillary region is somewhat limited by streak artifact from retained bullet fragments and fixation hardware involving both the mandibular and maxillary teeth. given these limitations, there is an extensively comminuted fracture of the mandible extending from the mid-body anteriorly, on both sides. there are innumerable metallic bullet fragments dispersed throughout the region of the mandible. there is a large metallic fragment seen adjacent to the lateral aspect of the right mandibular body (2:30). as expected, there is no evidence for osseous ___ compared to ct examination of only 17 days prior. there is marked soft tissue swelling bilaterally in the mandibular and maxillary regions, significantly more prominent on the right. the subcutaneous fat is extensively indurated and reticulated, bilaterally. however, no definitive fluid collection are seen either along the right or left mandibular/maxillary regions, and no foci of subcutaneous gas are identified in the soft tissues. probable 7-mm enhancing submental node is likely reactive (2:28). the right and left common, internal and external carotid vessels and bilateral jugular veins appear normal in caliber and opacification. the thyroid gland appears unremarkable. the partially visualized lung apices are clear.
in the right supraglottic region and the region of the aryepiglottic fold there is an area of increased density and some soft tissue asymmetry. this may be simply related to secretions, but one wonders about the possibility of malignant process here, possibly probably treated. clinical correlation is advised, and endoscopy may be of help. the nasopharynx appears relatively symmetric. there is a slightly prominent lymph node in the posterior chamber on the left side, measuring 12 x 8 mm in greatest dimension. there are slightly prominent nodes on the right side in the jugulodigastric region. the posterior one measures 12 x 9 mm in dimension and the anterior one measures 18 x 10. there is a slightly prominent left jugulodigastric node measuring 14 x 13 mm. there is an area of fullness associated with the inferior portion of the submandibular gland on the right side with a low- density center measuring 13 x 12 mm in greatest dimension. this may be an artifact but raises the question of a node or metastatic lesion in the submandibular gland or adjacent thereto. there is no evidence of bone erosion.
there is a large mass in the right vocal fold extending into the subglottis and possibly into the laryngeal ventricle and false cord. no convincing extra- retropharyngeal spread is noted. the mass appears to extend across the anterior commissure into the left true vocal cord. the right arytenoid cartilage is sclerotic. there is no pathologic adenopathy. there is carotid plaquing in the right ica. emphysematous changes are seen in the lung apices. there is a tracheostomy tube in place.
no prompting osh study of the cervical spine has been uploaded to pacs for comparison. for the findings involving the intracranial compartment, please see separately-dictated report of the concurrent cranial nect (clip #___). the patient is intubated. there is a minimally displaced coronally oriented type 3 fracture of the body of c2, which does not appear to involve the base or remainder of the odontoid process. the fracture extends laterally to involve both lateral masses, including their articular surfaces, though the lateral atlantoaxial articulations appear maintained. there is also involvement of the most posterior aspect of the foramina transversaria, bilaterally. however, the v2 portions of both the dominant left and relatively hypoplastic right vertebral artery demonstrate normal caliber, contour and enhancement, without evidence of acute injury. similarly, the remaining segments of both vertebral arteries demonstrate normal caliber, contour and enhancement from their subclavian origins through the vertebrobasilar junction, with no evidence of vascular injury at any other site. the aortic arch and remaining great vessel origins are unremarkable, without significant mural irregularity or flow-limiting stenosis. the common, internal and external carotid arteries demonstrate normal caliber, contour and enhancement, without significant mural irregularity or flow-limiting stenosis. there is no significant calcific or "soft" plaque involving the cervical vessels. the dmin measurements of the internal carotid arteries are as follows: on the right, proximal 7.5 mm and distal, 3.5 mm; on the left, proximal 8 mm and distal 3 mm, respectively. there is atherosclerotic mural calcification involving the cavernous segments of both internal carotid arteries, without flow-limiting stenosis. otherwise, there is a normal appearance to the anterior and posterior intracranial circulation, without significant mural irregularity, flow-limiting stenosis or aneurysm larger than 2 mm. though the study is not optimized for the evaluation of intracranial venous structures, there is an abnormal appearance to the left transverse sinus with a 14.5 mm ovoid collection measuring 280 ___, iso-enhancing to the immediately adjacent sinus, which appears attenuated (2:228). given the proximity of this process to the known extra-axial hematoma within this portion of the posterior fossa, adjacent to a prominent displaced occipital skull fracture, this is concerning for injury to the left transverse sinus with focal extravasation. there is normal opacification of the remaining dural venous sinuses.
there is swelling in the region of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle. it has the same density as the muscle but has a more heterogeneous component anteriorly. this would be consistent with a hematoma within the muscle but is could also be seen with adenopathy and mass lesion. this appears to be lateral to the internal jugular vein and does not appear to involve the common carotid, internal or external carotid arteries. there is some degenerative disease of the cervical spine. there is no evidence of mass or adenopathy on the left side of the neck.
again multiple facial fractures and a fracture through the skull base are identified. there is no evidence of extravasation of contrast seen in the petrous or cavernous carotid arteries. no evidence of inappropriate filling of the cavernous sinuses identified or distention of the superior or inferior ophthalmic vein noted. in the neck, the vascular structures are patent without stenosis, occlusion, or dissection.
the skull base appears normal. the floor of the mouth region is unremarkable. the cervical spine demonstrates no acute fracture. there is degenerative change of the lower cervical spine with facet joint hypertrophy. the fat planes are preserved. no fluid collections are identified.

2.2 x 1.1 cm area of soft tissue stranding with small locules of air in the left subclavicular region, locules of air and stranding of fat are also seen in the right subclavicular area, and most likely reflects sequela of subclavian line placement attempts. there is intravascular catheter in place, exact location is not certain in the absence of intravenous contrast. there are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes. limited evaluation of lung windows reveals no pneumothorax. there are no concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions in the imaged osseous structures.
again seen are surgical clips within the left thyroid bed consistent with patient's history of thyroid lobe resection. the right thyroid lobe is prominent in size and may contain a cyst. the appearance of the right thyroid lobe is unchanged from the prior study. no soft tissue masses are identified within the neck and no cervical lymphadenopathy is present. again seen are multiple enhancing lesions within the cerebellar hemispheres, unchanged in size and appearance from the previous study, consistent with patient's history of cerebellar hemangioblastoma. again noted is a defect within the occipital bone.
there is no abscess identified. there is fluid layering in the piriform sinuses. there is an asymmetric appearance at the level of the vocal cords, with somewhat prominent soft tissue/fluid on the right. this has a pointed configuration, and may represent retained secretions/fluid. however, this may also represent right vocal cord paralysis. clinical correlation is required. there is no adenopathy. the patient has a tracheostomy tube which appears well positioned. there is a surgical drain entering from the left neck anterior to the carotid artery and jugular vein, and coursing into the posterior mediastinum behind the trachea. there is evidence of a gastric pull through anastomosed to the cervical esophagus and residing in the right posterior hemithorax. there are no fluid collections related to this. skin staples are noted on the left. there is a right-sided chest tube. there is no pneumothorax appreciated on these limited images of the lungs. there is subtle emphysematous changes evident. the bones reveal the presence of dense maxillary sinus opacification. this appearance was present on the pet ct scan from ___, and is therefore subacute-to-chronic in nature. the maxillary sinuses themselves are relatively small, also suggesting an element of chronicity. there is a large ___ bullosa on the right.
a marker overlies the right cheek. no mass is detected. scattered cervical lymph nodes do not meet ct criteria for lymphadenopathy. the airway is patent. included views of the brain parenchyma are normal. the neck vessels are patent and normal in caliber. the thyroid is normal. included views of the lung apices are clear. the middle ear cavities, mastoid air cells, and included views of the paranasal sinuses are clear.
there is asymmetric soft tissue prominence involving the posterior soft tissues with involvement at the base of the tongue extending through inferiorly to the posterior hypopharynx with right greater than left asymmetry extending through to the larynx. there is suggestion of a more rounded mildly hyperenhancing component seen posteriorly best seen on images 2:26 and 2:29, immediately adjacent to the right aryepiglottic folds measuring 30 x 14 mm in the ap and transverse diameters is highly concerning for recurrence of disease. overall, these findings are highly concerning for extensive local spread of disease and direct visualization in this area is recommended. there is near-complete obliteration of the pharyngeal airway just inferior to the base of the tongue best seen on (2:35). there are multiple mediastinal prevascular lymph nodes that do not meet size criteria for pathologic enlargement, however, are concerning for foci of disease given known posterior pharyngeal mass. the patient is status post tracheostomy with tube in standard position. the thyroid enhances homogeneously. the visualized lung apices demonstrate extensive emphysema. the visualized osseous structures are unremarkable and visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses well aerated.

the endotracheal tube and ng tube have been removed in the interval. again noted are changes secondary to prior left neck dissection, with absence of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. no abnormal mass lesions are identified in the neck. evaluation of the tongue, the site of primary cancer, is severely limited due to dental artifact. however, no obvious large mass can be appreciated. the major vascular structures are unremarkable. no osseous abnormalities are appreciated. limited evaluation of the lungs reveals extensive abnormality at the lung apices, greater on the right than on the left. again noted are bullous changes with air fluid levels again identified.
again identified are the acute fractures of the anterior and posterior arches of c1 as described on the recent ct of the c-spine. as the right vertebral artery exits the transverse foramen of the c1 vertebral body and loops posteromedially to cross over the posterior elements of c1, there is a narrowing of the vertebral artery and more superiorly a total loss of opacification within the vertebral artery. just before the confluence of the vertebral arteries to form the basilar artery, there is reconstitution of the distal right vertebral artery. the left vertebral artery appears normal in caliber and contour throughout its course. the internal carotid arteries appear normal in caliber and contour throughout their visualized courses. no pathologic cervical lymphadenopathy is identified. the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells demonstrate mild mucosal thickening as well as a small retention cyst within the right maxillary sinus. the previously identified left subdural fluid collection is again seen on this study as well as the right frontoparietal and left posterior fossa encephalomalacia. the orbits appear unremarkable. foci of air are seen within the soft tissues near the vertex, consistent with known laceration in this region. incompletely visualized lung apices demonstrate mild dependent atelectasis. again seen is the posterior metallic hardware of the thoracic spine.
the small postoperative collection at the cervical laminectomy site is redemonstrated. again, extensive beam hardening artifact from fusion hardware limits assessment. the collection does not appear any larger than on the previous study. no new fluid collection is identified. a small amount of fluid secretions are present above the tracheostomy balloon. the visualized vascular structures are normal in course and caliber. the thyroid gland, trachea, and esophagus are unremarkable. limited assessment of the upper mediastinum is unremarkable. visualized portions of the lung apices show dependent areas of opacity. visualized intracranial structures are unremarkable.

calcifications from atherosclerotic change are observed along the aortic arch and within the walls of the subclavian arteries, and to a lesser extent at the origin of the left carotid artery and within the left common carotid artery wall. there is no significant stenosis of either common carotid artery. however, at the carotid bifurcations, there is dense mural calcification and irregularity of the vascular lumina. the presence of this calcification makes assessment of the remaining vascular diameter difficult, but there appears to be at least moderate narrowing of both carotid bifurcations, and moderate narrowing of the proximal internal carotid artery lumina as well. a few mural calcifications are noted in the cervical internal carotid artery walls. there is continuous opacification of the carotid arteries from the level of the arch to the intracranial segment. there is also continuous opacification of both vertebral arteries. there does not appear to be hemodynamically significant stenosis of either vertebral artery. there are large pleural effusions. increased density of the pulmonary parenchymal markings is also noted.
there remains some edema within the vestibular folds in the region of the vocal cords at the level of the glottis, however the appearance is decreased from the prior neck examination of ___. the trachea itself appears intact. again noted is filling defect of the left common carotid artery with distal reconstitution of the external carotid artery as previously seen. the internal carotid artery remains unopacified to the brain. no new fluid collection is seen. no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are identified. a previously seen fracture at the c2 vertebral body demonstrates healing. no acute fracture is identified. the prevertebral soft tissues are grossly symmetric and unremarkable. the included portions of the base of the brain, aside from occlusion of the left internal common carotid artery, appear normal. the included portions of the lung apices are clear. there is minimal mucosal thickening within the maxillary sinuses.
calcifications of the aortic arch and arch vessels are noted with mild midl ostial stenosis of the origins of the left internal carotid and subclavian arteries. calcification and possible mild stenosis are observed at the origin of the left vertebral artery. there is high-grade stenosis of both carotid bifurcations, with extensive atherosclerotic calcification which extend into the internal carotids approximately 1 cm. extensive calcifications and associated stenoses of the intracerebral carotid arteries are seen extending from the petrous through the precavernous and into the cavernous portions, the intrapetrous stenosis being somewhat more evident on the left side. the major tributaries of the circle of ___ are patent. mild peripheral cystic changes and blebs are seen in the lung apices. surrounding soft tissues are unremarkable. mild degenerative changes of the cervical spine and sternotomy wires are also noted.

previous scout images from the ct sinuses on ___ suggested prominence of the nasopharyngeal tissues. on this examination, again seen is some mild prominence of the prevertebral soft tissues. a thin, fluid density region, best seen on series 2, image 38, anterior to the prevertebral musculature may be secondary to a small amount of retropharyngeal fluid. it is not possible to be able to distinguish between a sterile and infected fluid collection by imaging alone. the airway is patent. submandibular nodes are within normal limits for size and shape. the thyroid gland is unremarkable.
there is dense calcific arteriosclerosis of the aortic arch. both subclavian arteries show mild-to-moderate luminal irregularity secondary to mixed plaque. the bilateral common carotid artery shows similar findings. the right common carotid artery has moderate luminal irregularity at its origin secondary to calcific plaque. at the level of c3, there is focal high-grade narrowing (70% luminal narrowing) due to mixed plaque. there is mild luminal irregularity of the right external carotid artery. there is mild-to-moderate luminal irregularity of the left internal carotid artery secondary to mixed plaque with 40% luminal narrowing. similar changes are seen in the left external carotid artery. the right vertebral artery is occluded to the level of c5 where there is thin reconstitution of flow. the right vertebral artery luminal diameter progressively increases to the takeoff of the pica where it again tapers. the left vertebral artery is occluded from its origin to the level of c4 where there is a thin string of contrast. the lumen remains attenuated throughout the remaining course of the left vertebral artery, particularly the v3 and v4 segments where there is calcific and soft plaque. the partially visualized intracranial vessels are significant for a severely atherosclerotic basilar artery which is likely hypoplastic as well, with focal high-grade stenosis at its mid portion. prominent bilateral posterior communicating arteries are partially visualized. a 1-cm diameter pocket of air just posterior to the right submandibular gland is seen. in addition, there is diffuse stranding of the fat of the right anterior neck within and anterior to the carotid space. here is severe biapical pulmonary scarring with severe underlying emphysema, partially visualized. mildly prominent mediastinal lymph nodes and heterogeneous thyroid with subcentimeter hypodense nodules, some with calcifications, are also seen.

this study is limited by the absence of intravenous contrast. allowing for this limitation, there are multiple prominent cervical lymph nodes at all levels and stations. the majority of these lymph nodes measure up to 1 cm in short axis and meet ct size criteria for lymphadenopathy. even though a number of these lymph nodes are not pathologically enlarged by ct size criteria, the multiplicity and wide extent make them compatible with lymphadenopathy. the visualized upper mediastinum demonstrates numerous, enlarged lymph node conglomerates in the bilateral axillary regions measuring up to 20 x 15 mm in the right axilla and 27 x 23 mm in the left axilla. multiple superior mediastinal lymph nodes appear prominent. the visualized lung apices are clear. the central tracheobronchial tree is patent. the visualized posterior fossa is unremarkable. the visualized paranasal sinuses and bilateral mastoid air cells are well pneumatized.
there is a 2.5 cm segment of occluded left subclavian artery involving the entire stented portion of the artery and extending to the origin of the left vertebral artery. reconstitution of the left subclavian artery more distally is explained by retrograde flow from the left vertebral artery, consistent with subclavian steal syndrome. bilateral calcified plaques are seen at the carotid bifurcations. there is a noncalcified portion of the plaque at the left carotid bifurcation, which causes a 29% stenosis. the right internal carotid artery measures 4 mm distally. a sub-4-mm right apical lung nodule is not significantly changed compared to ___. sternotomy wires are seen. there are no pathologically enlarged cervical lymph nodes.

patient has known squamous cell carcinoma with osseous metastasis. a dominant right chest wall mass is partially visualized today (2, 1), but better demonstrated on prior chest cta. also partially visualized are an endotracheal tube and a nasogastric tube, both in expected locations. a left approach subclavian central venous catheter enters the svc with the tip outside scope of current study. the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and lateral piriform sinuses appear patent. thyroid and cricoid cartilage appear unremarkable. infraglottic space appears within normal limits. airway is largely patent with endotracheal tube in place. there is minimal thickening at the level of cricoid and thyroid cartilage, which most likely represents the vocal cords. further evaluation in this region is limited due to presence of the endotracheal tube. also noted is an ill-defined area of density anterior to the endotracheal tube below the level of the vocal cords (301b, 70), which may represent synechia or scarring or secretion. more superiorly, the cervical soft tissue demonstrates asymmetry, with strap muscles partially removed on the left and metallic clips within left submental region. soft tissue thickening and stranding within the fat planes in the left neck may be related to prior surgery and radiation therapy in this region. prevertebral soft tissue evaluation is limited by presence of the endotracheal tube. multilevel degenerative disease is most prominent at c4-5, c5-6, c6-7. areas of heterogeneous lucency within the vertebral bodies may represent a mixture of degenerative changes and metastasis, which cannot be excluded. lytic metastatic changes are present in the upper thoracic spine, most pronounced in t4 vertebral body. additional irregular lytic changes are also present in bilateral medial clavicles and multiple upper ribs. the alveolar ridge demonstrates some irregularity, incompletely evaluated. asymmetric expansile appearance of the left anterior zygoma may be related to prior trauma and known zygomatic arch reconstruction, but underlying metastasis cannot be excluded. visualized portions of the neck demonstrate no lymphadenopathy by ct size criteria. arch vessels are patent. atherosclerotic calcifications are noted in vertebral arteries, left greater than right, near the take off from the subclavian arteries. there is also calcification in bilateral common carotid arteries near bifurcation, extending into their branches. intracranially, carotid siphon calcification is also noted. a subcentimeter well-circumscribed hypoattenuating lesion within the left lobe of thyroid is an incidental finding and may be evaluated on non-emergent basis as clinically indicated by ultrasound. within limitation of respiratory motion artifacts, partially visualized lung apices are clear, with the exception of previously described right chest wall mass.
the parotid glands are symmetric, without evidence of lymphadenopathy. the submandibular and sublingual glands are also symmetric. there are multiple level 1 lymph nodes visualized, none of which appear enlarged by ct size criteria. there are also numerous cervical level 2 through 4 lymph nodes, again none of which appear enlarged by size criteria. subtle detail through the left neck is limited by extensive streak artifact. this artifact is related to extensive reflux of injected contrast material from the brachiocephalic vein into the left internal jugular vein. this appears related to a luminal narrowing of the distal left brachiocephalic vein near the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins. overall, there is no abnormal focus of enhancement. the aerodigestive tract appears symmetric. the thyroid is not visualized. imaged portions of the lung apices are normal. osseous structures reveal no suspicious sclerotic or lytic lesions. the imaged paranasal sinuses reveal trace mucosal thickening of the maxillary sinuses bilaterally. note is also made of a right ___ bullosa. the imaged mastoid air cells are clear.

posterior to the cervical spine, within the soft tissues, extending from the vertebral bodies of c4 through c6, there is a 1.0 cm (ap) x 2.0 cm (transverse) x 4.1 cm (cc) fluid collection demonstrating rim enhancement. while findings could represent post-operative seroma, given history of purulent drainage from this site, this is concerning for abscess/infection. in addition, there is adjacent fat stranding which may be related to the fluid collection in addition to recent surgery. overlying skin staples are noted along the posterior aspect of the neck. the esophagus is patulous but thin walled.
there is no definitive abscess or fluid collection identified. the palatine tonsils and pharyngeal fat are asymmetric but are without mucosal hyperenhancement or discrete fluid collection. this could represent early phlegmon in the right clincical setting. although there is no definitive evidence for infection, a 1 cm right level ib lymph node is present and could be reactive. there is no associated fat stranding or overlying cellulitis. the jugular veins are suboptimally visualized but appear grossly patent. there are no exophytic mucosal lesions. the airways are patent. the thyroid gland is normal without nodules or abnormal areas of enhancement. the lungs show centrilobular emphysema and traction bronchiectasis within the left upper lobe which could suggest prior granulomatous disease. the imaged portion of the intracranial structures are unremarkable.
imaged portions of the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta demonstrate mild atherosclerotic calcification. there is a common origin of the left common carotid and innominate arteries. there is narrowing at the origin of the right vertebral artery. left vertebral artery origin appears normal. both carotid and vertebral arteries show normal flow without stenosis, occlusion or dissection. there are mild atherosclerotic calcifications seen at the origin of both internal carotid arteries.
soft tissue delineation of the nasopharynx is difficult to elucidate given the presence of secretions. again seen is ill-defined soft tissue associated with the esophagus in the post-cricoid region and hypopharynx in the area of previous fdg avidity. lack of soft tissue delineation limits ability to fully evaluate. note is made of a mild narrowing of the airway at the insertion site of the tracheostomy. slight fullness of soft tissue at the base of tongue on the left may be related to streak artifact and asymmetry of the scanning plane. a right ij central venous catheter is present. vascular structures of the neck are intact. there is no lymphadenopathy. the osseous structures are unremarkable. evaluation of the upper chest and mediastinum including pulmonary lesions and left upper lobe postoperative change is better evaluated on concurrent ct torso.
there is no hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, or evidence of major vascular territorial infarct. the ___-white matter differentiation is preserved. the maxillary sinuses are somewhat atretic bilaterally. the remainder of the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells remain normally aerated. limited views of the lung apices show small bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis. rounded opacity in the paraspinal aspect of the superior segment of the right lower lobe (3:10) containing are cyst, likely represent a focus of atelectasis.
as seen on recent ct of the cervical spine, there is fusion of the c6 and c7 vertebral bodies, likely congenital. anterolisthesis of c5 on c6 measures 5 mm and is unchanged from the prior exam. the c5 facet is locked in front of the superior facet of c6 on the right. there are associated fractures of the c5 right transverse foramen, both anteriorly and posteriorly as of right c5 lamina. there is also a right transverse process fracture at c6, also through the transverse foramen. linear lucency through the c5 vertebral body on the left extends to the pedicles. there is moderately extensive prevertebral edema and/or hematoma.

there is a small amount of air within the neck (right greater than left). this air likely represents the patient's recent central line placement. this air tracts from the masticator space on the right to the level of the cricoid. there is no evidence of soft tissue mass within the neck. an et tube is in position terminating above the carina. an ng tube is in position within the esophagus. no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are identified within the neck. the airway appears patent. no abnormal prevertebral soft tissue swelling is identified. pulmonary parenchymal consolidation is identified within the dependent portions of both lungs. small amount of fluid is present within the nasal cavity which likely reflects the patient's intubated status. bone windows show no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions. immediately medial to the left anterior mandible there is a 1.5 x 1.0 oval shaped hyperdensity which appears of bony density, and is likely an unusually situated osteoma.
there is no evidence of an abscess in the neck. there is a mild amount of stranding in the fat immediately adjacent to the portacath in the right chest wall. there is no focal fluid collection. there is no evidence of a venous thrombosis. there are no masses and no lymphadenopathy in the neck. there is a linear opacity at the right lung apex consistent with scarring or atelectasis. there is no abnormality of the osseous structures of the neck.
opacification of the vascular structures is limited due to bolus timing and infusion rate. a stent is in place within the right common carotid artery and internal carotid artery. there is focal narrowing within the mid portion of the stent without evidence of occlusion. the right common and internal carotid arteries are patent. there is contrast opacification of the external carotid artery, which arises in the mid portion of the stent. the vertebral artery on the right is not visualized clearly at its origin, and is markedly attenuated throughout its course. the left vertebral artery is dominant. the left common carotid, internal and external carotid arteries are patent. the imaged vessels of the circle of ___ appear patent. note is made of opacification of multiple venous collaterals within the neck, finding of uncertain significance but possibly related to injection rate. the osseous structures demonstrate degenerative change of the cervical spine. a mucous retention cyst versus polyp is seen in the right maxillary sinus. the remainder of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are normally pneumatized.
unfortunately, cta contrast bolus is poor, limiting evaluation of the vertebral arteries. however, the vertebral artery on the left appears grossly patent. of note, the previously identified, mildly displaced fractures of the left transverse processes of c7 and t1 are again seen. the left vertebral artery is seen adjacent to the anterior portions of these transverse processes and has not yet entered the vertebral artery foramen, which occurs at c6. limited evaluation of the remainder of the arterial structures within the neck are unremarkable. the visualized portions of the brain are unremarkable. moderate mucosal thickening of the maxillary sinuses bilaterally is noted, left greater than right. small air-fluid levels are noted in the maxillary, ethmoid, and sphenoid sinuses bilaterally. visualized mastoid air cells are unremarkable. the patient's endotracheal and nasogastric tube appear to course appropriately. limited evaluation of the upper lung fields demonstrates dependent opacities bilaterally, which may represent atelectasis; however, contusions cannot be excluded. remainder of the soft tissue and osseous structures are unremarkable. alignment of the cervical spine appears normal.
aside from mild hyperdensity of the right parotid gland compared to the left, the glands are now symmetric, without adjacent periinflammatory stranding. there is no asymmetry of the retropharyngeal soft tissues. there are a few scattered level 1 and 2a lymph nodes, none of which meet ct criteria for pathologic enlargement. the vertebral and carotid arteries are patent. the visualized lung apices demonstrate bilateral pleural effusions, new compared to the prior examination.
as was noted on ___, massive spinal metastatic disease centered at c7/t1 is re-identified and unchanged. secondary to hardware artifact, the evaluation of intrathecal soft tissue detail is limited on this study. while this mass enhances, suggesting it is vascularized, the exact arterial supply of this mass is indeterminate in this study. posterior fusion hardware of c5 through t2 is re-visualized, however, only the c5 pedicle screws appear to have any placement within bone, again unchanged. fracture through bilateral t2 pedicle screws is again appreciated. the acute angle kyphosis and severe anterolisthesis predominantly at the c7/t1 level is again noted and unchanged compared to ___. scarring is again identified at the lung apices bilaterally. surgical clips are seen in the region of the thyroid bed. an enhancing left parietal scalp mass is identified on series 2, image 220 and measures 1.9 x 0.8 cm, likely representing a metastatic lesion. limited evaluation of the visualized portion of the brain is unremarkable. opacification of a left frontal sinus air cell is noted. remainder of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are normally aerated. no stenosis or obstruction is noted of the carotid or vertebral arterial systems bilaterally. at no point are the vertebral arteries encased by tumor.
there are chunky vascular calcifications within the arch of the aorta as well as the common carotid arteries bilaterally. the right internal jugular vein is not present and the patient appears to be s/p right neck dissection. the carotid arteries are well visualized and there is no evidence for aneurysm, pseudoaneurysm, or fistula. the right vertebral artery is diminutive. the visualized portions of the intracerebral arteries appear to be unremarkable. numerous collaterals are noted in the posterior soft tissues of the neck which presumably are secondary to removal of the right internal jugular vein. comparison with old films would be very helpful in assessing disease status. no gross disease is currently appreciated. the patient is s/p tracheostomy. degenerative changes are noted in the cervical spine. bullous changes are noted in the lung apices. gas is noted in the innominate vein. the above findings were confirmed with multiplanar reformations.
there is a 2.5 x 4.1 mass within the left thyroid lobe extending superiorly and medially, and also extending inferiorly into the superior mediastinum. this mass has areas of low attenuation with calcifications at the margin. there are several other calcified masses on both sides of the superior mediastinum and in the thyroid region. the left anterolateral first tracheal ring is eroded and irregular where abnormal soft tissue abuts it. this area of the airway is impressed and mild narrowing results. additionally, within the midline, in the region of the thyroid isthmus, at the level of the cricothyroid membrane, there is a 3.2 x 4.4 cm heterogeneously enhancing mass with a calcific density in the center, which appears to extend through the cricothyroid membrane into the paratracheal region of the infraglottic space. this is indistinguishable from the soft tissues surrounding the airway at that level. soft tissue surrounding the airway at the level of the cricothyroid membrane extends more superiorly and has resulted in irregularity of the left arytenoid cartilage and asymmetry of the left larynx, most notably the vallecula and piriform sinus. additionally, there are several lymph nodes with calcified rims, in both the left anterior triangle and supraclavicular regions. there is severe spinal stenosis due to extensive cervical spondylosis. no lytic lesions of the bones are identified.
the patient is intubated with appropriate termination of the endotracheal tube about 3.5 cm above the carina. presence of the endotracheal tube somewhat distorts the normal anatomy of the airway including larynx. no definite airway narrowing is identified. an oral enteric tube passes through the esophagus with terminus out of view. there are extensive atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic arch, but no focal aneurysm is seen within the field of view. large areas of airspace consolidation are noted of the dependent upper lungs bilaterally consistent with aspiration or pneumonia. no concerning osseous lesion is seen.
there is diffuse atherosclerosis of the arch of the aorta and proximal great vessels. aside from mild narrowing of the origin of the right vertebral artery, the vertebral arteries bilaterally are normal in caliber without stenosis or occlusion. the right carotid artery is patent throughout its course with a patulous region around the bifurcation secondary to prior carotid endarterectomy. the left carotid artery demonstrates significant atherosclerosis at the bifurcation after which evaluation of the internal carotid artery is difficult since only intermittent glimpses are available as it courses cephalad. it is difficult to determine whether the internal carotid artery demonstrates complete occlusion with intermittent collateral visualization versus a very small region of patency which occasionally is below the resolution of this study. a continuous region of patency is noted in the cavernous portion of the internal carotid artery and beyond as it enters the circle of ___. calcification of the vertebral arteries is noted intermittenly throughout their course as well as cavernous portion of the carotids. mucosal thickening is noted in the maxillary sinuses, ethmoid air cells and sphenoid sinuses bilaterally.
there appears to be sequelae of the known right carotid injury due to attempted right internal jugular vein placement with the appearance of a focal intimal flap best seen on series 4, image 276. there is obscuration of fat planes in this region, compatible with the history of prior instrumentation. the intracranial vessels appear all patent. on the non- contrast ct there are bilateral hypoattenuating lesions in the thalami consistent with subacute infarcts. there also is loss of ___- white matter differentiation in both occipital lobes best seen on series 2a, image 17 which are consistent with more recent infarction. there are no mass lesions. no intracranial hemorrhage is seen. there is no evidence for hydrocephalus.

the vessels and soft tissues of the neck are unremarkable. there is no evidence of abnormal fluid collections to indicate abscess formation. there are scattered, nonpathologically enlarged lymph nodes within bilateral submandibular and posterior chain areas. when compared to the previous study they are unchanged in appearance. there is again some dental artifact, which slightly obscured the detail within the oropharynx. however, there is no evidence of soft tissue asymmetry. the paranasal sinuses are well-areated.
the ct angiography of the neck demonstrates normal appearance of the carotid and vertebral arteries without stenosis or occlusion. the patient has known spinal tumor at t1 level, which is not apparent on the cta examination. it should be noted that ct is not an ideal method for evaluation of the vascularity of the spinal neoplasm. no enlarged vascular structures are identified at the level of t1.
the patient is status post left frontal craniotomy, two vascular clips are identified in the territory of the anterior communicating artery and left internal carotid artery, causing significant metal/streak artifact. there is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass, mass effect, or shifting of the normally midline structures. punctate calcification is noted on the left frontal region (image #16, series #2). vague area of low attenuation is noted in the anterior limb of the left internal capsule, lateral to the head of the caudate nucleus (image #17, series #2), measuring approximately 4 x 3 mm in size, possibly consistent with small perivascular space versus lacunar infarct. the perfusion maps demonstrate increased mean transit time with decreased blood volume and decreased blood flow on the right occipital lobe, vascular territory of the right posterior cerebral artery. on the non-contrast images, there is no evidence of low attenuation or hyperdense vasculature. the images with contrast demonstrate patency of the major vessels including the anterior and middle cerebral arteries. in the neck, there is atherosclerotic calcification involving the right cervical carotid bifurcation and causing severe narrowing at the origin of the right internal carotid artery with a combination of soft plaque and calcified plaque material (image #128 and 134, series #4). on the left cervical carotid bifurcation, also soft plaque and calcified plaque is identified (image #136, series #4). the origin of the vertebral artery demonstrates narrowing on the right with small atherosclerotic plaque (image #30, series 500b). there is also a calcified plaque at the origin of the left vertebral artery (image 31, series 500b). dense atherosclerotic plaques are also visualized at the aortic arch. the bony structures demonstrate multilevel degenerative changes, consistent with anterior and posterior spondylosis, more significant from c3/c4 through c6/c7 levels. the airway appears patent. the thyroid gland appears unremarkable, and the lung apices are clear.
the skull base and soft tissues of the neck are normal. no discrete fluid collection is identified in the neck. the right axillary lymph nodes are mildly enlarged, measuring up to 8 mm, likely related to right upper extremity cellulitis. similarly, there is obscuration of fat planes in the low neck into axilla, again compatible with the history of infection. this exam is not designed for intrathoracic evaluation except to note bilateral pleural effusions/atelectasis and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes (largest in the ap window measuring 11 mm-2:05). rounded low density foci in the left lobe of the thyroid are nonspecific and measure up to 1 cm.
there is a comminuted fracture of the left clavicle with numerous small bone/bullet fragments in the left supraclavicular space in the topography of the left brachial plexus, but its evaluation is limited in this ct study. the gunshot tract is noted from the left cervical soft tissues to the left anterior upper chest. the cervical spine demonstrates normal anatomic alignment with no neuroforamina narrowing or spinal canal stenosis. multiple small nonspecific lymph nodes are present in the posterior triangle chains and in the internal jugular chains bilaterally. they show symmetric, homogeneous enhancement without calcification, central necrosis or central hypodense centers. the lobes of the thyroid gland appear normal and symmetric in size. they show homogeneous enhancement. there is normal opacification of the internal jugular chains and both common carotid arteries. the infra glottic and supraglottic airway appear within normal limits and there is no abnormality seen at the level of the hypopharynx, oropharynx or nasopharynx. there is a partially seen opacification in the left lung apex which may represent lung contusion. please refer to same day chest ct.
evaluation for lymphadenopathy is limited without intravenous contrast. the previously seen large right supraclavicular lymph node is no longer apparent. in its space, there are multiple small lymph nodes measuring up to 8 mm (300b:56), not enlarged by ct size criteria. mild soft tissue stranding is seen in the supraclavicular areas bilaterally, which may be related to fluid overload. the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and hypopharynx are unremarkable. there is no evidence of large dental or peritonsillar fluid collection. streak artifact from dental fillings obscures details in the oral cavity, but no mass lesion is seen. the submandibular and parotid salivary glands are unremarkable. the glottic and subglottic airway is unremarkable. atherosclerotic calcifications are seen in the carotid arteries, but further evaluation is limited. the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated. allowing for slice selection and technique, the imaged included portion of the brain is unremarkable. the visualized lung apices demonstrate bilateral pleural effusions, larger than on ___. interlobular septal thickening suggests mild pulmonary edema in the appropriate clinical setting.
there are prominent and hyperenhancing jugulodigastric, posterior cervical triangle, and submental lymph nodes. for example, a left jugulodigastric node (2:29) measures 16 mm x 12 mm and a right jugulodigastric node (2:29) measures 17 mm x 13 mm. a right posterior cervical triangle lymph node (2:38) measures 15 mm x 12 mm. these findings may be reactive. both parotid glands are slightly hyperenhancing, though no discrete abscess is identified, and may reflect changes from reported history of parotiditis. the submandibular glands are normal in appearance. the thyroid gland enhances homogeneously, without evidence for nodule. there is moderate mucosal thickening of the left maxillary sinus. an endotracheal tube tip terminates immediately inferior to the thoracic inlet. an orogastric tube is only partially imaged. limited views of the lung apices reveal bilateral large pleural effusions, which are better assessed on concurrent chest ct. osseous structures are unremarkable. diffuse infiltration of the soft tissues may reflect anasarca.
the parotid glands are abnormal being slightly enlarged with an irregular cystic pattern. this might represent a mikulicz's syndrome in a patient with an autoimmune disorder such as lupus erythematosis. there are scattered cervical lymph nodes in both cervical chains which are not definitely enlarged at this time and are only minimally prominent compared to the normal person. no discrete masses are identified.
the area of the lower lip lesion is obscured by dental artifact, now well evaluated on this study. no significant lymphadenopathy is identified within the neck. there are scattered tiny lymph nodes along the jugular chain, which are not enlarged by ct criteria. scattered calcification is seen of the carotids and the aortic arch. no soft tissue mass lesions or fluid collections are identified within the neck. the vascular structures are normal in appearance. the osseous structures are normal. within the visualized portion of the lung apices, no pulmonary nodules or parenchymal consolidation are identified.
soft tissue prominence of the soft palate with hypodense centers and enhancing rim probably indicates normal fat-containing material, and not an inflammatory process.. note is made of multiple small pockets of air predominantly located in the musculature of the right temporalis, pterygoid and masseter muscles. no soft tissue swelling, fat stranding, or localized fluid collections are seen in this area. this raises the question if the patient had recent instrumentation in this area, clinical correlation is needed. of note, air is also seen in multiple blood vessels, liekly veins, in the neck region on the right side and anteriorly extending down into the upper mediastinum/thoracic inlet. the visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses are clear. the airways are patent. there is a probable prominent right laryngeal ventricle, having the appearance of a divterticulum.
endotracheal and orogastric tubes are in place. the airway is entirely effaced by soft tissue density, it is not well evaluated. there is also a left internal jugular central venous catheter. no definite adenopathy is seen within the neck, though evaluation of the supraclavicular regions is limited by streak artifact. however, adenopathy is seen within the superior mediastinum, including a large pretracheal lymph node which measures 2.7 x 3.0 cm (2:4). there is central low attenuation within this lymph node. there is also prevascular lymphadenopathy seen. there is a small left pleural effusion which is partially imaged, and adjacent atelectasis. the cervical vasculature opacifies appropriately with contrast. no suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic lesions are seen. there is partial opacification of ethmoid air cells and sphenoid sinus, possibly related to intubation.

there is occlusive thrombus within the right internal jugular vein beginning approximately at the level of c6 (2:44) and extending to the confluence of the internal jugular vein and subclavian vein where there is a small amount of non-occlusive thrombus in the right subclavian vein (2:67, 300b:31). extensive phlegmonous reaction in the right neck extends from the carotid sheath into the retropharyngeal and paravertebral spaces with fluid tracking anterior to the vertebral bodies predominantly at the level of c3 (2:31). the heterogeneity of the soft tissue stranding particularly in the region of the carotid sheath (2:46) suggests that there may be a small amount of hematoma. however, no organized collections or abscess are present and there is no active hemorrhage. the inflammatory stranding and phlegmonous change extend into the upper mediastinum particularly along the right paratracheal border (2:69, 76). on the ct of the chest from eight days prior the right paratracheal region was thin; now there is mediastinal widening with inflammatory reaction. no gas is present within the subcutaneous tissues. although the right internal jugular vein is occluded as described, no other vascular occlusions are identified. several enlarged nodes are present in the lower neck (2:57) measuring up to 7 mm. the visualized lung apices are clear and the trachea and proximal right and left main stem bronchi appear normal. no suspicious bone lesions are identified and there is no bone destruction at the level of the paravertebral fluid collection.
overlying subcutaneous reticulation as well as enhancing, ill definied soft tissue density in the right parotid space is more prominent since 2 days prior. thickening of the right masseter muscle raises concern for spread into the masseter space, however, there is no evidence of retropharyngeal extension. scattered nodes throughout the neck do not meet ct size criteria for pathologic enlargement. the submandibular glands are unremarkable. post surgical clips near the parotidectomy bed, calcification in the left parotid gland as well as hypodense and calcified nodules in the thyroid gland are unchanged since ___. emphysema in the lung apex is similar to ___.

there is massive cervical lymphadenopathy throughout the neck bilaterally, displacing and distorting normal tissue planes. majority of the lymphadenopathy demonstrates low-attenuation center, consistent with necrosis. large conglomerate lymph nodes have completely occluded the right internal jugular vein, and narrow and likely occlude the left internal jugular vein at the level of the thyroid cartilage. there is a large amount of retropharyngeal fluid, which could possibly relate to lymphatic obstruction due to lymphadenopathy. evaluation of the lung apices demonstrates bilateral pleural effusion, and parenchymal opacities, which are more completely evaluated and described on concurrently performed ct of the chest.
there is an ng tube with the tip located in the fundus of the stomach. there is a tracheostomy tube with the tip in good position. there are multiple small lymph nodes in the neck, but none of them meet ct criteria for pathology. no evidence of neck mass is seen. all the vessels in the neck are patent.
extensive atherosclerotic calcification is noted in the aortic arch and at the origins of the arch vessels. there is also extensive atherosclerotic calcification at the origin of the left vertebral artery. however, there is opacification of the left vertebral artery throughout its entire course. there is decrease in the caliber of the left vertebral artery, after the origin of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery, which can be a normal variant. however, it is unclear if the vertebral artery is opacifying through forward or reversed flow, due to lack of information about temporal filling on ct angiogram. the right vertebral artery has some calcification at its origin. however, it is patent throughout its course and has normal caliber. the right vertebral artery is dominant. the basilar and the posterior cerebral arteries are patent. the p1 segment of the right posterior cerebral artery is hypoplastic, with fetal pca pattern. extensive atherosclerotic calcification is noted involving the common carotid arteries, their bifurcation, and proximal cervical internal carotid artery on the left side, cavernous internal carotid artery segments. in the right common carotid artery bifurcation, the stenosis is approximately 50-60%. in the left proximal internal carotid artery, the stenosis is approximately 70%. however, there is no limitation of flow. the anterior, middle cerebral, and the anterior communicating arteries are patent. no obvious aneurysm is noted in the major arteries visualized. there are no obvious neck masses. the thyroid appears unremarkable, with limited evaluation due to beam hardening artifacts from the contrast in the adjacent jugular vein. the visualized lung apices appear unremarkable. on the sagittal reformations, multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the cervical spine, most prominent at c5-6, with narrowing of the disc space. however, these are incompletely evaluated on the present study.
the patient is markedly kyphotic. again noted is evidence of laryngectomy and a tracheostomy stoma. there is slight asymmetry of the pharyneal airway due to patient positioning. the laryngeal surgical site and neck soft tissues cannot be adequately assessed due to the technical outcome of this exam. visualized portion of the upper chest again demonstrates multifocal bilateral airspace opacities. several small mediastinal lymph nodes are seen. the visualized portion of the great vessels appear normal. osseous structures demonstrate mild degenerative changes.
cta of the neck: there is a common origin of the brachiocephalic artery and the left common carotid artery, with moderate mural calcifications at the origin. there is also mild calcifications along the brachiocephalic trunk at the level of the bifurcation to the right common carotid and subclavian arteries. the left common carotid shows a significant narrowing at the bifurcation, with moderate focal calcifications at the bifurcation. while the exact quantification of degree of stenosis is limited by the artifact associated with this calcification, the degree of stenosis is estimated at approximately 50 percent. on the right, there is moderate narrowing at the carotid bifurcation, with mild degree of calcification and some mural plaque. assessment of the degree of stenosis at the right common carotid bifurcation is mildly impaired by the calcifications, but estimated to be approximately 40 percent. the cavernous portions of both carotid arteries demonstrate moderate mural calcifications. examination of the circle of ___ demonstrates a diminutive left vertebral artery. both vertebral arteries appear patent. the major tributaries of the circle of ___ otherwise appear patent, and no aneurysm is seen within the limitations of this examination. mild aypical scarring is seen bilaterally.

there is no evidence of mass or adenopathy within the neck. the submandibular glands are indeed slightly prominent. there is membrane thickening within the right maxillary sinus.
there is a lobular ulcerated mass of the left paramedian lip which is roughly 3.5 cm in maximal dimension. the adjacent mandible shows no definite evidence of lytic or erosive change. within the left submandibular space there are two lymph nodes which measure 1.5 cm maximally, and are of slightly heterogeneous attenuation. this is suspicious for local nodal metastasis. within the anterior and posterior cervical chains, there are no abnormally enlarged or necrotic-appearing lymph nodes. the floor of the mouth and base of the tongue are of normal density. there is no asymmetry of the pharyngeal surfaces. there are tiny calcifications in the pharyngeal tonsillar tissue. the nasopharynx appears normal. the parapharyngeal spaces are normal. the muscles of mastication appear normal. vascular structures demonstrate normal enhancement bilaterally. there is carotid artery calcification, especially at the bifurcations. the parotid and submandibular glands are of normal size and density. the larynx appears normal. the thyroid gland is small and of homogeneous normal density. no supraclavicular adenopathy is identified. the superior mediastinal fat appears clear. there is aortic calcification. within the visualized portions of the upper chest there is evidence of left upper lung atelectasis and a moderate left effusion. there is a small right pleural effusion. no destructive changes of the bony structures are identified. there are sternal wires in place. as indicated on the head ct report, there is opacification of the left maxillary sinus.
an endotracheal tube is seen entering the trachea just below the level of the hyoid bone. nasogastric tube is in place. at the region of the arytenoid cartilages, there is prominence of the vocal cords. due to technical difficulties, there is not good contrast enhancement (please see ct of the chest of the same day); however, no significant enhancement is identified within this region in question. the retropharyngeal and peritonsillar spaces appear unremarkable, and there is no evidence of abscess in this region. surrounding osseous structures are remarkable for a cystic lesion in the mandible filled with soft tissue material. it is in the midline of the mandible, measuring 23 mm in greatest axial dimension. also seen is left maxillary mucosal sinus thickening. the right mastoid air cells also appear opacified.
the study is compared with the remote enhanced mr examination of the cervical spine of ___. as on that study, there is a well-defined intradural extramedullary lesion, within the dorsal aspect of the thecal sac at the level of the odontoid process. this is extensively calcified or ossified and significantly indents the dorsal surface of the spinal cord and measures roughly 17 mm in craniocaudal dimension, perhaps 50% larger than on the earlier mr study. based on the original mr signal and enhancement characteristics and its relative stability and extensive calcification, this very likely represents a meningioma, common in this region. no other such abnormality is seen within the included imaging volume. though there is no radiographic skin marker to indicate the site of clinical concern, there is no focal skin thickening or induration of the subcutaneous fat, and no evidence of phlegmon or discrete fluid collection. the deep tissue spaces and their intervening fat planes are preserved. specifically, there is no inflammatory process in the masticator, submandibular, or submental spaces to specifically suggest odontogenic infection, and no bone destructive process or discrete periapical abscess is identified in either the maxilla or the mandible. there are numerous small lymph nodes in the submandibular region and anterior and posterior cervical triangles, bilaterally, none meeting ct size criteria for pathologic enlargement; however, these are essentially unchanged in size and in number since the remote mr study. the remainder of the examination, including the ___-, oro-, and hypopharynx, oral cavity, supraglottic region, and region of the vocal cords is unremarkable. the parotid, submandibular, and thyroid glands are similarly unremarkable. the included caudal portion of the paranasal sinuses is clear. incidentally noted in the limited imaging of the lung apices is a well-marginated, pleural-based, low-attenuation lesion at the posteromedial aspect of the right lung apex, measuring 17 ___. this may be a bronchogenic or other cyst of developmental origin, but would be an unusual location for the former, and does not definitely communicate with the aerodigestive tract at the thoracic inlet. this lesion is incompletely imaged, and no similar lesion is identified elsewhere in the limited imaged portions of the thorax. no previous cross-sectional imaging of the chest has been uploaded into pacs, and this lesion is not definitely appreciated on the previous frontal radiographs.
the right vertebral artery is diminutive; however, both vertebral arteries opacify normally with no evidence of occlusion or dissection. the vertebral arteries enter into the transverse foramen at c6 and there is normal opacification of the distal vertebral arteries, basilar arteries, and cervical portions of the internal and external carotid arteries. osseous structures reveal chronic-appearing fractures of the bilateral c7 pedicles. on the right there is a linear lucency through the c7 pedicle with jagged but sclerotic edges (2:99) and no osseous fusion, suggesting an old right pedicular fracture. on the left at c7, there is a fracture extending through the left pedicle and through the left transverse foramen (2:99) also with a mildly sclerotic rim suggesting a chronic fracture. degenerative changes are seen at c5 through c7 with joint space narrowing, anterior and posterior osteophytosis, and slight loss of vertebral body height at these levels. the visualized lung apices demonstrate dependent atelectatic changes with no pneumothorax. there is mild opacification of the maxillary sinuses, left greater than right.
tracheostomy tube is seen in place: there has been interval embolization of bilateral laryngeal arteries. there is a hypopharyngeal mass appearing grossly similar to the prior study measuring up to approximately 2 cm in thickness. the heterogeneous enhancement within this mass suggests necrosis. there is extension into bilateral piriform sinuses but assessment of supraglottic extension is difficult. superiorly in the oropharynx, secretions are seen. there is no extravasation of contrast. there are no obvious enlarged lymph nodes. again seen is plaque at the left carotid bifurcation and minimal plaque at the right ica. again, the left vertebral artery appears to be occluded at its origin. the right vertebral artery is patent. lung apices are essentially normal. bilateral mastoid air cells are partially opacified. there is bilateral maxillary sinus mucosal thickening.
tracheostomy tube is noted in expected position without evidence of erosion into vascular structures. a heterogeneously-enhancing region of soft tissue is noted in the region of the vallecula likely representing known vallecular carcinoma. hypoattenuation is noted within the nasopharynx possibly representing secretions. there is moderate lobulated mucosal thickening within the maxillary sinuses. calcified atherosclerotic plaque is present at bilateral carotid bifurcations with greater than 50% narrowing bilaterally. there is a right dominant vertebral artery system. a small amount of patchy opacity is present within the right lung apex most consistent with aspiration.
there is diffuse infiltration of the fat within the right carotid space and posterior cervical space. in addition, prominent lymph nodes are seen in this distribution posterior to the right sternocleidomastoid muscle. there is no discrete fluid collection though evaluation is somewhat limited due to streak artifact at the level of the lower neck. the findings do suggest a phlegmon in the setting of infection. there is also bilateral palatine tonsillar enlargement, likely reactive. an 8 x 7 mm hypodense right thyroid nodule is present. there are no exophytic mucosal masses and no other areas of focal mass effect. salivary glands are unremarkable in appearance. the neck vessels enhance bilaterally without evidence of stenosis or thrombosis. the visualized portions of the lung apices are unremarkable.
there is extensive metallic streak artifact in the region of the left pterygoid and infratemporal fossa, limiting evaluation. tere remains marked soft tissue swelling in the region of the oropharynx, particularly in the region of the left tongue base. however, there are no abscesses or fluid collections present. the visualized carotids and jugular vessels appear intact, although there is atherosclerotic plaque, particularly at the right carotid bifurcation. there are several metallic fragments causing streak artifact in the left anterior temporal lobe which limits evaluation. there is slight hypodensity in the left anterior temporal lobe, which may reflect sequela of infarct to this region, but there are no fluid collections. evaluation of the circle of ___ intracranial vessels is limited without cta technique, but appear unchanged since the prior cta. the sphenoid sinus is nearly fully opacified with fluid. there is minimal mucosal thickening of the maxillary sinuses. the mastoid air cells are nearly completely fluid-filled. a tracheostomy is in place. the patient is status post median sternotomy and cabg.
the patient is intubated and the airway is collapsed around the endotracheal tube. two foci of air are seen adjacent to the hyoid bone. foci of air are also seen posterior to the right and left clavicles. the lack of iv contrast limits evaluation of the vasculature. the visualized lung bases are clear. redemonstrated is diffuse subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage at the base of the brain. the osseous structures demonstrate degenerative disease most prominent at the c5/6 level. there is bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy with a probable lymphnode mass in right level 3 region but evaluation is limited in absence of contrast.
there is an intimal flap identified in the distal internal carotid artery on the left side. this is similar to the finding seen on the mra, 2d time-of-flight examination. findings are consistent with a focal dissection. both the true and the false lumen demonstrate flow. otherwise, there is no evidence of vascular stenosis seen in the neck. no occlusion is identified.
the right vertebral artery is dominant. it appears normal in caliber without evidence of irregularities to suggest a dissection. the left vertebral artery is nondominant. while a mild narrowing of its v1 segment is suspected on the source images and routine coronal/sagittal two-dimensional reformatted images, this is not confirmed on the curved reformatted images from the imaging lab. the v2 segment of the left vertebral artery is normal in caliber without evidence of irregularities to suggest dissection. there is minimal plaque in the proximal right internal carotid artery without evidence of a hemodynamically significant stenosis. the left cervical carotid system appears normal. the distal cervical internal carotid arteries measure 4.6 mm in diameter on the right and 4.3 mm in diameter on the left. a complex fracture of c6 vertebral body is again noted, described in detail in the second opinion on the preceding cervical spine ct scan. mild dependent opacities in the imaged right upper lung are likely related to atelectasis.
patient is status post tracheostomy. there is some evidence of postoperative edema and subcutaneous gas consistent with recent procedure. again noted is a large mass arising from the right thyroid gland causing leftward displacement of the trachea, infiltrating posteriorly and anterior to the trachea. compared to prior study, the left lobe of the thyroid appears larger. the posterior aspect of the mass also appears larger. again seen is likely adenopathy. visualized portion of the lung apices appear unremarkable.
since the examination of ___, there has been extraction of three right-sided molars with sockets visualized within the right mandible. visualization of the surrounding soft tissues is somewhat limited by streak artifact, however, no definite focal fluid collection is identified about this region to suggest abscess. the parapharyngeal fat planes appear intact. the airway is patent. there are numerous nonpathologically enlarged lymph nodes within the submental, submandibular, anterior and posterior cervical triangles. within the right maxillary sinus, a rounded soft tissue density consistent with mucous retention cyst versus polyp is noted. there is stable discontinuity of the medial walls of the maxillary sinuses, possibly post surgical in nature. the internal carotid arteries and internal jugular veins appear patent bilaterally. the visualized portion of the lung apices appear unremarkable. the thyroid gland appears within normal limits.
there is no fluid collection or hematoma in the neck. there is again noted prominent soft tissue around the trachea. there is a traceostomy tube and stent in the trachea. there is a small amount of fluid around the trachea which is most likely post surgical. all the major vessels in the neck appear to be patent. there are small lymph nodes in the neck that do not meet ct criteria for pathology. there is mucosal thickening and possibly a polyp in the right maxillary sinus. the other sinuses are clear. the thyroid is within normal limits. this study is compared with the ct of the chest from ___, again demonstrates extensive peritracheal soft tissue thickening, which remains unchanged since the prior exam.
the exam is slighlty limited secondary to motion. the aortic arch shows extensive noncalcified and calcified plaque, some of which appear ulcerated. the left common carotid is diminutive throughout its course and is completely occluded at the bifurcation. a thin strand of contrast opacification is seen distally leading into and through the carotid canal, which may represent a wisp of retrograde filling or collateralization. the remainder of the major vessels including the vertebrals and right carotid are patent throughout its course. note is made of tortuosity of the origin of the vertebral arteries. the right distal and proximal internal carotid artery measures 5.2 and 5.3 mm, respectively. the lung apices are clear. mild bronchial wall thickening and irregularity is consistent with chronic airways disease. the left sphenoid sinus contains aerosolized secretions. the cervical spine shows multilevel degenerative change.
the left v2 vertebral segment demonstrates occlusion without active contrast extravasation/ the occluded segement is at the c5-6 level, corresponding to the level of injury. this occlusion is likely to be due to a dissection but could be due to extrinsic compression by the displace osseous fragments. the left v3 and distal intracranial left v4 segments demonstrate contrast opacification from retrograde flow. the right vertebral artery and bilateral cervical arteries demonstrate normal contrast opacification without evidence of a dissection. fractures in the left lamina of c5 and left c5-c6 facet are better demonstrated on the ct cervical spine study. the origin of arch vessels and vertebral arteries are patent. the aortic arch demonstrates no dissection. the basilar artery demonstrates an apparent small filling defect concerning for a thrombus in this setting of verterbral vessel occlusion. it is possible that the appearance of the basilar artery is due to a hypodense artifact, rather than an intraluminal defect. an mr ___ ___ of the basilar may be helpful in confirming or excluding a filling defect.
again noted is a prevertebral soft tissue collection centered at the c4 through c7 level measuring 5.4 (cc) x 3.0 (ap) x 3.8 (trv) cm, similar to the recent mr. the collection contains locules of gas and an air fluid level. the esophagus is not well delineated on this exam and a direct communication with the collection cannot be excluded. secretions are noted within the trachea. although, no definite fistulous tract is identified on this study, the exact location of small locules of gas posterior to the trachea at the level of t1 (2:71) is indeterminate. there is extensive osseous erosion from c4 through c7 level as before. also again noted is an osseous cleft at the level of c5-6. locules of gas appear to track within the cleft (2:53). evaluation of the spinal canal is limited due to posterior spinal fusion hardware creating metallic artifact; however, there is no definite epidural collection. the left vertebral artery is diminutive compared to the right, similar to prior ct. there has been prior right neck dissection. severe biapical emphysematous changes are again noted, similar to prior.
there is significant streak artifact from dental amalgam, limiting evaluation. within that limitation, there is moderate enlargement of the left palatine tonsil with diffuse hyperenhancement as compared to the contralateral side, most consistent with infection/inflammation. small foci of gas centrally (2, 38) are suggestive of early phlegmonous change, although no large focal collection or mass is detected. this inflammation and hyperemia extend superiorly into an area of eccentric frayed appearing thickening within the supraglottic anterior oropharynx on the left (2,50), which also demonstrates a mild degree of enhancement. this could represent a combination of hyperemia and/or reactive lymphoid hypertrophy within the waldeyer's ring. numerous enlarged lymph nodes are seen bilaterally along the anterior cervical chains, measuring up to 14 mm on the left and 12 mm on the right. cervical vasculature appears intact. the esophagus appears patulous, with areas of thickening anteriorly, for example series 2, image 78, which could represent retained secretion or food particles, although concurrent infection cannot be excluded. with the exception of opacification of a single ethmoidal air cell, remainder of paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells appear well aerated. globes and soft tissues appear unremarkable. limited visualization of the intracranial structures and vessels demonstrate no obvious abnormality. small nonhemorrhagic bilateral pleural effusions are present, right greater than left. multifocal streaky ground-glass opacities within the lungs as well as apical predominant interlobular septal thickening are seen, likely a combination of residual infection and mild degree of volume overload. osseous structures are intact. congenital non-fusion of posterior arch of c1 is noted, of little clinical significance.

carotid and vertebral arteries and their major branches are patent with no evidence of stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm formation. the distal cervical internal carotid arteries measure 4.3 mm in diameter on the left and 4.5 mm in diameter on the right. note is made of diminutive left vertebral artery, which terminates as the pica. the transverse foramina that the left vertebral artery courses through are small, suggeesting that the diminutive nature of the artery is most certainly congenital.
the fracture is visualized through the left c2 pedicle in the region of the superior articular facet extending through the foramen transversarium. the vertebral arteries appear normal, without evidence of dissection. the visualized carotid arteries also appear normal. no other abnormalities are noted.
ct neck: no evidence of vascular injury is identified in the neck. left upper rib fractures involving the second and third rib is seen with pulmonary contusions, which are further evaluated by torso ct. no evidence of dissection or extravasation of contrast in the neck.

the imaged lung apices show emphysematous changes, right greater than left. there are no lung nodules or masses within the imaged portion of the chest. the esophageal stent contains air and contrast material. the left neck drain has been removed. the right neck drain remains in place. there are multiple foci of air and high density material within the soft tissues of the neck, specifically within the left neck at the site of the prior drainage tube and surrounding the esophageal stent. the high density material likely represents oral contrast. a new fistula track is seen extending from the right neck drain at c4 to the skin surface (series 2, image 21). the previously noted collection within the cervical spinal corpectomy defect spanning from c4 - c6 has increased in size and contains an air-fluid level, likely oral contrast. the collection is located just posterior to the fibular bone graft strut. anterior to the bone graft, multiple foci of air are seen within prominent prevertebral soft tissues. the patient is status post posterior fusion from c4-t1. there is no evidence of hardware loosening. the left picc line has been retracted and now its tip sits in the left brachiocephalic vein, previously within the superior vena cava. the spinal cord is better evaluated on the mr cervical spine obtained subsequent to this study.
the patient is status post tracheostomy with the distal tip terminating 4.7 cm above the carina. a nasogastric tube courses inferiorly out of the imaging volume. allowing for presence of the ng tube, the nasopharyngeal soft tissues are symmetric. the lingual tonsils appear symmetrically prominent, which could simply represent lymphoid hyperplasia, but should be correlated with direct visualization. the supraglottic airway is patent but narrowed symmetrically, with significant paraglottic edema, likely reactive. however, there is no nodularity or definite asymmetry to indicate a mass. there is also ill-defined edema of the prevertebral soft tissues, which may reflect reactive inflammation, related to the recent instrumentation. assessment of the subglottic airway is somewhat limited by the tracheostomy tube, but without evidence of discrete mass. the anterior extent of the tracheostomy tube appears slightly displaced to the right by a prominent left lobe of the thyroid gland, which appears enlarged and heterogeneous in attenuation, with interspersed tiny calcifications (for example, 300b:15-16). there is a tiny nodular hypodensity in the right thyroid lobe. scattered borderline cervical lymph nodes are present, most prominent at level iia, measuring up to 15 x 12 mm, on the left, and 14 x 8 mm on the right. there is symmetric diffuse fatty atrophy of parotid glands. the submandibular salivary glands appear unremarkable. partially imaged intracranial contents appear within normal limits. there is dependent fluid within the left maxillary sinus, somewhat hyperdense, suggestive of proteinaceous inspissated component or fungal colonization. moderate left nasal septal deviation is present with a bony spur. mastoid air cells are well aerated. there is no periapical periodontal disease. mild multilevel cervical spondylosis with canal narrowing is present, most pronounced at the c5-6 level. lung apices are clear. post-surgical changes of left occipital craniectomy for meningioma are noted.

hyperdense material is seen causing loss of fat planes and producing significant expansion at the tongue base and musculature of the floor of the mouth. findings are most consistent with a massive sublingual hematoma given the acute onset of symptoms. hematoma extends along the parapharyngeal soft tissues causing thickening of the epiglottis and right aryepiglottic fold. elevation of the tongue produces severe narrowing of the upper airway. the subglottic airway appears widely patent. stranding and thickening along the right platysma muscle is likely inflammatory in etiology. no pathologically enlarged cervical chain lymph nodes are identified. the tyroid gland enhances homogeneously. there is near complete opacification of the right maxillary sinus. the mastoid air cells are normally pneumatized and aerated. significant periodontal disease is noted with periapical lucency involving the right second and third mandibular molars.

the examination is limited because iv contrast could not be administered. there is no fluid collection detected within the neck or otgher evidence of abscess. an endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and jugular catheter are identified. there are a few scattered lymph nodes seen within the neck. a question was raised about the possibility of epiglottitis. due to the endotracheal and nasogastric tubes, the epiglottis could not be identified as a separate structure on the current study.
there is non-flow-limiting atherosclerosis at the origin of the left common carotid artery and left subclavian artery. there is non-flow-limiting atherosclerosis at the carotid bulbs bilaterally. there is heavy atherosclerotic calcification at the origin and within the proximal left internal carotid artery, which due to associated artifact makes it difficult to get an accurate luminal diameter, but just distal to this, there is no post-stenotic dilatation, and the remainder of the cervical internal carotid artery appears normal in caliber with mild atherosclerotic calcification just before the petrous portion of the vessel. there is bilateral heavy atherosclerotic calcification in the visualized cavernous internal carotid arteries. the cavernous and other intracranial segments are not included on the present study. the right internal carotid artery is unremarkable. the distal left internal carotid artery measures 5 mm in diameter and the distal right measures 4 mm in diameter. there is atherosclerotic calcification at the origin of the left vertebral artery without definite flow-limiting stenosis. the artery is otherwise normal in caliber. there is also a focal area of atherosclerotic calcification in its v4 segment just prior to the takeoff of the pica. there is also some atherosclerotic calcification at the origin of the right vertebral artery which does not appear to be flow limiting. the remainder of the right vertebral artery appears normal in caliber with appropriate opacification with minimal atherosclerotic calcification of its v4 segment. the lungs demonstrate extensive emphysematous changes in the apices. there also appears to be suture material versus calcification along the superior right pleura. please correlate with clinical history. in the neck and visualized upper mediastinum, there is no lymphadenopathy though there are several small lymph nodes. dentition is poor with loss of a number of teeth and periapical lucencies surrounding several of the remaining teeth. there is a focal region of the left maxilla which appears eroded. in the cervical spine, incompletely visualized is multilevel spondylosis.
again, a collection of air is identified in the post-cricoid region with a drain extending to the upper esophagus. compared to the prior study, the component of the drain in the esophagus appeared to be slightly higher at t2 level compared to the t3 level on the previous study. there is slight fullness of soft tissue seen on both sides of the neck, but evaluation is limited as there is no contrast present. postoperative changes are again seen in the spine.
the patient is status post tracheostomy. there is subglottic edema extending towards the glottis, which can be associated with the tracheostomy procedure itself. the presence of the tracheostomy itself makes it difficult to evaluate the supraglottic region. several small cervical lymph nodes are seen which do not meet criteria for pathologic enlargement. there is extensive cervical spondylosis, as described in the ct of the cervical spine done on ___. there are bilateral pleural effusions as well as associated atelectases, which are incompletely evaluated. pharyngeal tonsillar calcifications are noted, likely from chronic infection. the visualized paranasal sinuses redemonstrate opacification of several ethmoid air cells, also likely inflamamtory in origin.

the study is compared with the most recent cranial mri and mra and cervical mra, dated ___. not significantly changed from that study is relatively mild global atrophy with disproportionate ventriculomegaly, representing preferential central component or underlying communicating hydrocephalus. there is no finding to specifically suggest transependymal migration of csf. there are chronic lacunes in the head of the right caudate nucleus and anterior aspect of the left putamen, unchanged, with no finding to specifically suggest acute vascular territorial infarction. there is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage and the midline structures are in the midline. noted is extensive and occlusive-appearing calcification involving the intracranial vertebral and carotid arteries. there is extensive predominantly soft but also calcific plaque involving the entirety of the included aortic arch. this includes an apparent short-segmental dissection involving the origin of the left subclavian artery (3:39), which maintains distal caliber and contrast enhancement. similar, irregular predominantly soft plaque involves the carotid arteries through their bifurcations, which appear markedly ectatic on the left, perhaps related to previous cea. while there is also extensive, predominantly calcific atherosclerotic plaque involving the intracranial course of both icas, there is likely no more than 50% diameter stenosis involving the cavernous and paraclinoid portions. the ica dmin measurements are: on the right, proximal 4 mm and distal 7.5 mm; on the left, proximal 8 mm and distal 6 mm. thus, there is roughly a 50% diameter stenosis involving the proximal right ica, while the left bifurcation and proximal ica appear to have been treated by endarterectomy. there is atherosclerotic plaque involving the origins of both vertebral arteries, with likely no more than 50% origin stenosis, probably more marked on the right. however, as on the mr examination, there is extensive both soft and calcific plaque involving, particularly the v4 segments of both vertebral arteries, at the level of the skull base, with alternating segmental stenoses and post-stenotic dilatation. this includes diffuse narrowing of the vertebrobasilar junction, itself, with at least 50% diameter stenosis. this process also involves the origin and proximal portion of the basilar artery, with likely greater than 60% stenosis, though comparison is made with likely slight post-stenotic dilatation of the immediately-more distal vessel. the overall appearance does not appear significantly changed since the cranial mra (e.g. that study, 104:11). however, the current study demonstrates marked concentric stenosis of the distal right vertebral artery, at the ipsilateral pica origin, with very attenuated or even, occluded vessel, and some flow to the inferior aspect of the right cerebellar hemisphere, apparently provided by the patent contralateral vessel. as before, this process spares the remainder of the basilar artery, as well as its superior cerebellar and posterior cerebral branches which are patent, without significant mural irregularity or flow-limiting stenosis. the remaining vessels of the circle of ___ and their major anterior circulation branches are also unremarkable, without significant mural irregularity or flow-limiting stenosis. prominent anterior and small caliber bilateral posterior communicating arteries are identified, with no aneurysm larger than 2 mm. there is prompt symmetric opacification of the principal dural venous sinuses and major deep cerebral veins, without flow-limiting stenosis. small "filling defects" involving the lateral aspect of the left transverse sinus at its junction with the sigmoid sinus, likely correspond to the prominent arachnoid granulations at this site demonstrated on the previous mr. the remainder of the examination demonstrates small mucus-retention cysts along both maxillary antral floors, unchanged since the nect of the neck of ___. there is no cervical lymphadenopathy or discrete or exophytic soft tissue mass. the thyroid, submandibular and parotid glands are unremarkable. the included lung apices are grossly clear. there is no superior mediastinal adenopathy. the patient is status post median sternotomy and cabg.

nasogastric and endotracheal tube are in place. just to the left of the endotracheal tube is a small low-density area measuring 8 mm in greatest dimension, which could represent a small abscess. the tongue does appear low in density, consistent with the clinical history of edema of the tongue. the nasopharynx is not well assessed because of the presence of the tubing. definite pathologic adenopathy is not identified. there is a cystic- appearing space measuring 15 x 23 mm associated with the inferior aspect of the thyroid gland, which could represent a thyroid lesion or a contiguous cyst.
both vertebral arteries are patent and normal in caliber throughout their length. bilateral common carotid, external and internal carotid arteries are patent and normal. however, the sensitivity of ct angiography for evaluation of intramural hematoma is unknown. hence, intramural hematoma/dissection cannot be completely excluded based on this study alone. again noted are c2 transverse foraminal fractures noted bilaterally. there is mild mucosal thickening noted in the left maxillary sinus.
there is a large cystic structure in the right mid neck air-filled in keeping with air filled external laryngocele, which in comparison with the prior study has increased in size, is completely air-filled, and measures 5.7 (104b:30) and 4.7 x 3.4 cm (2:66). there is no concerning rim enhancement. there are prominent lymph nodes at level 2 on the right, in close proximity to external laryngocele. there is mucosal thickening in the right maxillary sinus, and ethmoid air cells. small blebs are seen at the right lung apex as seen before.

tracheostomy tube, mediastinal wires as well as hardware from anterior spinal stabilization and cage placements are identified. comminuted fractures of the posterior elements of c7 and t1 are again seen. a fragment adjacent to the right scapula creates streak artifact. the previously noted fluid collection within the right trapezius muscle has significantly decreased since the prior exam. on post-contrast images, a small residual fluid can be seen, measuring up to 1.8 cm in diameter. this is seen on series 3, image 19. in the superior mediastinum, the previously described abnormal fluid collection to the left of midline is not well appreciated due to streak artifact. however, this seems to have decreased in size as well. opacity within the left lung apex remains.
there has been a considerable decrease in the extent of a large soft tissue mass in the right oro- and nasopharynx, with residual fullness and infiltration. it continues to engulf the common carotid artery on this side. more inferiorly at the level of the thyroid cartilage, there is still some narrowing of the airway by soft tissue, although it is improved from the prior study. some irregularity is seen is of the posterior wall of the oropharynx. there is new diffuse superficial soft tissue stranding consistent with post- radiation change. the patient has a new tracheostomy. the lung apices demonstrate minimal scarring. the visualized brain parenchyma appears unremarkable. no air-fluid levels are seen in the paranasal sinuses. again seen is degenerative change of the cervical spine.

comminuted fracture involving the c1 vertebral body is again visualized. the relationship between the dens and the clivus appears grossly maintained. prevertebral soft tissue swelling, anterior to the fracture site, does not appear to be significantly increased compared to the ct of four days prior. soft tissue swelling and hematoma about the fracture causes focal posterior indentation on the upper cervical spinal cord, which also appears to be grossly stable compared to the previous study. the airway is grossly patent. no significant mass effect on the esophagus is noted. the visualized lung apices are clear.
non-contrast ct head: there is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus. there are bilateral white matter hypodensities, periventricular and in the right basal ganglia, and likely represent sequelae of chronic small vessel occlusive disease and lacunar infarcts, not significantly changed. mildly prominent ventricles and extra- axial csf spaces, relate to mild diffuse parenchymal volume loss, and unchanged. the visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses and the mastoid air cells are unremarkable. atherosclerotic calcifications are noted in the cavernous carotid arteries on both sides. a lucent lesion, in the left occipital bone likely represents venous ___ or arachnoid granulation and is unchanged (0.5 x 0.5 cm).
there are pockets of air noted in the right side of the neck, in the posterior spinous soft tissues, extending throughout the neck, as well as down into the superior part of the chest, likely related to some intervention most likely related to the pleural drainage tube. any associated inflammation, in this location, is not adequately assessed, due to lack of iv contrast. within the limitations of lack of iv contrast, no large area of fluid collection is noted in the neck. there is grade 1 retrolisthesis of c4 over c5, not appreciated on the prior mri study. multilevel degenerative changes, are noted in the cervical spine, along with sclerosis and endplate irregularity at c4-5, corresponding to the previously noted osteomyelitis described on the prior mr studies. an area of decreased attenuation, in the prevertebral space, (2, image 33), at the level of c5-c6, likely relates to the hypopharynx. the previously described small amount of prevertebral edema/fluid collection is not well- assessed on the present study, given the lack of iv contrast. this is not the ideal study to evaluate for intrathecal contents. however, within these limitations, no large space occupying lesion, is noted, in the spinal canal. there are areas of increased attenuation in the lung apices on both sides, left more than right along with pleural effusions on both sides and small amount of air on the pleural cavity on the right side, likely related to the pleural drainage tube. however, this is not completely assessed on the present study.
right subclavian port courses in expected position. in the region of the port catheter, there is occlusive thrombus that begins at the right brachiocephalic vein-svc junction, and extends superiorly to involve the entire right subclavian vein and majority of the right internal jugular vein. this appears hyperdense and expansile on noncontrast ct, with occlusive filling defect on postcontrast images. there is luminal reconstitution of the distal internal jugular vein, without intradural extension of clot. right and left sigmoid sinuses and left internal jugular vein are patent. in the right neck, there is mild subcutaneous edema and fat stranding, but no drainable or organizing fluid collections suspicious for abscess. reactive level ii and iii nodes on the right measure up to 6 mm. the airway is widely patent. there is no evidence of tonsillar, parapharyngeal, or retropharyngeal abscess. note is made of a right palatine tonsillolith. epiglottis, aryepiglottic folds, and vocal cords are unremarkable. aortic arch and branch vessels are normal. common, external, and internal carotid arteries are unremarkable. visualized posterior fossa is normal. the paranasal sinuses are well aerated. mastoid air cells and middle ear cavities are clear. there is mild cerumen in the right external auditory canal. there is a multinodular thyroid, with dominant 1-cm lesion in the left lobe demonstrating complex septations and calcifications. pleural parenchymal scarring is noted at the lung apices. mild loss of disc space is present at c6-c7, with anterior osteophyte formation.

again identified is a non-displaced fracture through the left occipital bone extending into the left occipital condyle. there are sclerotic changes in the left t1 lamina as well as in the right inferior articular facet of c5 likely secondary to degenerative change. there are stable air-fluid levels in the maxillary sinuses, bilaterally. there is biapical atelectasis and pleural effusions. there is mild hyperplasia with calcification of the aorta. there is minimal calcification at the carotid bifurcations and at the origin of the right internal carotid artery. the vertebral arteries are normal in course and caliber without evidence of stenosis or occlusion. the common, internal, and external carotid arteries are patent without evidence of stenosis or occlusion. there is no evidence of dissection involving the extracranial arterial vasculature. there is no significant disc bulge, neural foraminal narrowing, or spinal canal stenosis involving the cervical spine.
as noted on the prior mri, there is a large mass in the region of the right tonsillar pillar which extends from the hard palate to approximately the level of the false cords. the contrast bolus is noted to be poor, and there is not optimal contrast enhancement of the soft tissues. the previously seen probable necrotic region in the center of the mass on the mr is not visualized on this study. this may be due to the poor contrast enhancement. therefore, if there remains clinical concern for an abscess/fluid collection, consider obtaining a repeat mri of the neck with gadolinium. as before, the fat planes in the right parapharyngeal space are obliterated, and there is soft tissue infiltration consistent with tumor. at some levels, the abnormal soft tissue appears to surround the right internal carotid artery. however, it remains patent in its entirety. as compared to the prior examination, the size of the mass appears relatively unchanged. there is sclerosis of the right arytenoid cartilage. there is no definite evidence of cervical lymphadenopathy. there has been interval placement of a tracheostomy tube with collapse of the upper airway at the level of the mass.

there has been interval introduction of a drainage catheter into the inferior aspect of an extremely large left submandibular and sublingual/floor of mouth mass with resultant air within the inferior aspect of the mass. the mass is partially necrotic inferiorly and a normal left submandibular gland is not identified. inferiorly, the mass extends to involve the left strap muscles and is intimately associated with the left lobe of the thyroid gland. the mass also extends in the suprasternal notch. no definite foci of bony dehiscence are noted. particularly, the left mandible appears to demonstrate intact cortex. there is an enlarged left level 2 lymph node. there is a 1.6 x 1.8 cm left thyroid nodule which is partially calcified, recommend correlation with ultrasound. there is an endotracheal tube in place with complete effacement of the pharyngeal and laryngeal airway. the airway is deviated to the right from the mass lesion. there is opacification of bilateral ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses. mild mucosal thickening in bilateral maxillary sinuses is also seen.
there is a three-vessel arch. there is moderate calcification of the aortic arch and the origins of the innominate, left common carotid, and subclavian arteries. there is calcified plaque at the left subclavian artery origin causing mild stenosis. the left vertebral artery is not visualized and is presumably occluded. there is only minimal segmental opacification of the left vertebral artery in its mid portion which may reflect collateral flow from the contralateral side. there is good flow in the distal left subclavian artery. the right vertebral artery is dominant and demonstrates mild calcification approximately 1 cm from its origin. there is also calcification noted in the distal cervical and intracranial vertebral arteries bilaterally, right greater than left. evaluation of the left carotid artery demonstrates extensive atheromatous plaquing in the common carotid artery and the bulb, causing approximately 40% stenosis. there is also calcified plaque at the origin of the ica with mild approximately 30% narrowing. calcification of the left pca origin is also noted on the left. on the right, there is a somewhat patulous appearance to the ica. no high-grade stenosis is seen. there is also a calcified plaque in the common carotid artery which causes approximately 30% stenosis. intracranially, there is calcification of the cavernous icas bilaterally. there is opacification of the right sphenoid sinus. there is an old infarct in the right cerebellum. there is extensive cervical spondylotic change noted.
there is a rather well-defined, homogeneously enhancing 1.6-cm mass within the right parotid gland, which may represent a primary parotid neoplasm, such as a pleomorphic adenoma, or an intraparotid lymph node. smaller, equal to less than 6 mm, similar-appearing additional masses are seen within both parotid glands, at least three on the right and one on the left, which most likely represent intraparotid lymph nodes. within the neck outside the parotid glands, there is no evidence of lymphadenopathy, and the soft tissues are grossly within normal limits. there is an irregularly shaped and incompletely imaged at least 4.5 x 4.0 x 1.6 cm mass within the right lung apex, which likely represents a known tumor. no lymphadenopathy is seen in the visualized upper mediastinum. there is mild mucosal thickening in the left sphenoid sinus. the mastoid air cells and middle ear cavities are free of fluid. there is cervical spondylosis, without a suspicious osseous lesion to suggest bony metastasis.
