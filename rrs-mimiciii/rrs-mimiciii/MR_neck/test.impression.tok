faintly visible increased signal within the proximal portion of the left internal carotid artery. this could be related to either a high grade stenosis such as a string sign or signal within an intraluminal thrombus while almost totally occluding the left internal carotid artery at the bifurcation. the absence of the signal on the first images within the intracranial portion of the left ica favors probably total occlusion of the vessel. if there is clinical indication, angiographic correlation might be helpful. high grade 80 to 90% stenosis involving the origin of the right internal carotid artery. patent vertebral arteries. it might be worthwile to obtain an mra of the intracranial circulation.

markedly diminished flow in left internal carotid in the neck. diminished flow vs. occlusion within the right internal carotid in the neck. the examination is limited due to motion and for better evaluation of these abnormalities, gadolinium enhanced mra of the neck is recommended. mra of the head would also be helpful for further evaluation.
