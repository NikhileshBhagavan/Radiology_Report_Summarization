the endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are in anatomic position. there is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling, acute fracture or subluxation. the intervertebral disc spaces and vertebral body heights are maintained. the visualized outline of the thecal sac is unremarkable. a right first rib fracture is identified. a tiny right apical pneumothorax is also identified, and a minimal region of pleural based soft tissue thickening adjacent to the anterior aspect of the right second rib- ? tiny hematoma next to a fracture.
the lung apices show peripheral small subpleural bulla. the esophagus is somewhat dilated proximally, of unclear significance. there is bilateral calcification at the carotid bifurcations, likely atherosclerotic changes. there is mild mucosal thickening in the left sphenoid sinus. the overall alignment of the cervical spine is preserved without listhesis. there are multilevel spondylitic changes with osteophytes from c2-c3 through c6-c7 and intervertebral disc space narrowing at c4-c5 and c5-c6. there is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling. although ct is not ideal for evaluation of the intrathecal contents, the cord appears normal to the extent visualized. there is no evidence of fracture, dislocation or bony destruction.
no acute fracture is noted. collection around odontoid process with encroachment of ventral cord is suggestive of hematoma in setting of trauma. multilevel disc space narrowing is noted at multiple levels. there is ankylosis of the c5- c6 vertebra. mild grade 1 retrolisthesis of c4- c5 is most likely degenerative in nature. multilevel facet hypertrophy and uncovertebral joint hypertrophy is noted with multilevel neural foraminal narrowing. multilevel disc bulges is noted which is most severe level of c2- c3 and c3-c4. multiple non- pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are noted inside the neck. incidental note is made of linear scarring of the left lung apex.
there is no evidence for acute fracture or malalignment. there is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling. biapical pulmonary contusions are incompletely imaged. endotracheal tube and esophageal catheter are incompletely imaged. visualized portions of the thyroid and soft tissues are unremarkable.
there is evidence of spondylosis at multiple levels in the cervical spine, with anterior and posterior osteophytes, disc osteophyte complexes, and uncovertebral osteophytes. there is also diffuse osteopenia, with a slightly heterogeneous appearance of the dens. there is grade 1 retrolisthesis of c3 over c4. at c2-3, there is a small disc osteophyte complex, causing minimal indentation on the ventral thecal sac. at c3-4, there is a broad-based disc osteophyte complex, causing mild indentation on the ventral thecal sac. bilateral uncovertebral osteophytes are noted, causing moderate neural foraminal narrowing on the right side. at c4-5, there is mild narrowing of the disc space, endplate sclerosis, disc osteophyte complex, causing mild indentation on the ventral thecal sac. uncovertebral osteophytes are again noted, right more than left, causing moderate narrowing on the right side. at c5-6, there is narrowing of the disc space, with posterior disc osteophyte complex, uncovertebral osteophytes, causing bilateral moderate neural foraminal narrowing and moderate indentation on the ventral thecal sac. at c6-7, there is narrowing of the disc space, disc osteophyte complex, along with uncovertebral osteophytes, causing moderate-to-severe neural foraminal narrowing. there are also facet degenerative changes noted at multiple levels. no pre- or para-vertebral soft tissue swelling or masses are noted. significant atherosclerotic vascular calcifications are noted near the origins of the arch vessels, in the common carotid, subclavian arteries, as well as in the cervical internal carotid arteries and intracranial vertebral arteries, not adequately assessed on the present study. no definite sclerotic foci are noted in the cervical spine. there is a partially imaged sclerotic focus in the t3 vertebral body, which is better assessed on the dedicated ct of the t-spine, performed concurrently.
the patient is status post orif of c1 and c2 fracture with wires and pedicle screws. two pedicle screws are noted through the lateral masses of the atlas one of each side in position. however, the tips of the screws are extending slightly more anteriorly than expected, more so on the left side where the tip is seen extending outside the anterior cortical margin (series 2, image 19). the pedicle screws through the c2 are in intact position with the left screw slightly extending more anteriorly but within the bone. there is no evidence of surrounding lucency to suggest loosening. the left- sided screws are in close proximity to the transverse foramina. however, accurate assessment and relationship to the vertebral arteries is limited on the present study. postsurgical changes are noted in the form of soft tissue swelling and edema in the posterior spinal soft tissue with drain noted within. multilevel degenerative changes, noted in the remainder of the cervical spine have not significantly changed. there is straightening of the cervical spine. there is a hypodense area, posterior to the right lobe of the thyroid, (series 3, image 69), measuring 1.3 x 0.9 cm which may represent a nodule. this needs further assessment with ultrasound of the thyroid. evaluation of the thecal sac contents is limited on the present study.
