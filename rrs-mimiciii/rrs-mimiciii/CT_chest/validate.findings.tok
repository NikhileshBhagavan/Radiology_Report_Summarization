the heart is normal in size and there is no pericardial effusion. the thoracic aorta is normal in caliber and contour. the lungs are clear. there are no pulmonary nodules or opacities or pneumothorax.
secretions are again layering within the mid-trachea. otherwise, the central airways are patent to the subsegmental levels. there are multifocal bilateral predominantly peripheral nodular and mass-like areas of consolidation, compatible with septic emboli. right lower lobe areas of consolidation are newly apparent; these were probably previously present but obscured by the now improved right lower lobe collapse. otherwise, no new consolidation is seen. none of the previously visualized lesions are larger, and many show some decrease in size. also while some lesions show new cavitation, others previously demonstrating cavitation no longer demonstrate an air cavity. for example, mass-like consolidation in the peripheral right upper lobe has decreased from 3.0 cm to now 2.7 cm, and now shows new central cavitation (3:29). mass-like consolidation abutting the pleural surface in the lingula has decreased from 3.2 x 5.7 cm to now 3.0 x 5.5 cm (3:33); central air cavity in this lesion is no longer visualized, and it is noted that some areas within this lesion measure fluid density. mild emphysematous changes at the right apex are as before. the bilateral pleural chest drains seen on ___ ct have been removed, and there is a new pigtail pleural catheter on the right. small bilateral pleural effusions with heterogeneous density, enhancing rind, and loculated appearance is unchanged on the left but decreased on the right. there are tiny scattered foci of pneumothorax on the right as well as minimal overlying subcutaneous gas near the entry site of the new catheter. while the right lower lobe has reexpanded, there remains dependent atelectatic changes adjacent to the pleural effusions, particularly in the left lower lobe. small right upper paratracheal, prevascular, and bilateral axillary nodes are increased in number but do not meet size criteria for adenopathy. an aortopulmonary window node has increased from 10 mm to now 13 mm in short axis (2:26). a lower right paratracheal node measures 8 mm in short axis (2:26). hilar nodes measure up to 11 x 22 mm on the right (2:29), and 13 x 20 mm on the left (2:28). an epicardial node has decreased from 8 to now 7 mm (2:47). there is no pericardial effusion. the aorta is of normal caliber. while the current study is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic diagnosis, no mass is seen arising from the visualized portions of the adrenal glands. a 2.7 cm rounded structure containing fluid and layering high density is seen arising from the gastric cardia, probably representing a diverticulum, also previously present. no region of bony destruction is seen. old lateral right third rib fracture is noted. rudimentary cervical ribs are also noted bilaterally. degenerative endplate changes are present along the inferior endplates of t6 and t7.

contrast opacification of the pulmonary vasculature is sufficient to exclude pulmonary embolism in the central and segmental arteries. in general, there is a massive progression of disease. the size of the mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes has substantially increased. the hilar and mediastinal lymphatic material now occupies large parts of the mediastinum, surrounding and partially compressing the left and right pulmonary arteries, the aorta, the carina as well as the left and right main bronchus, the superior vena cava, and the azygos vein. instead of the previously visible metastasis in the left lower lobe, the entire left lower lobe is now occupied by a large parenchymal opacity, representing a combination of atelectasis and pneumonia. in addition, newly appeared foci of infection are visible in both upper lobes as well as in the middle lobe. nondependent thickening of the interlobar septa as well as thickening of the peribronchial lymphatics strongly suggests the presence of lymphangitis carcinomatosa. this is further supported by newly appeared bilateral pleural effusions. newly appeared relatively extensive pericardial effusion. there is no safe evidence of osteodestructive lesions.
ct of the chest with iv contrast: the bolus timing is slightly suboptimal. however, there is no evidence of pulmonary embolism in the central or segmental pulmonary vasculature. small subsegmental pulmonary embolisms cannot be entirely excluded. there is bibasilar atelectasis. the heart size is within normal limits without pericardial effusion. there is no mediastinal or axillary lymphadenopathy.
again noted is an arteriovenous malformation in the right lower lobe anteriorly abutting the pericardium. of note is that no contrast opacification occurs due to occlusion of the supplying pulmonary artery. in addition, the malformation now measures 16 x 21 mm, whereas previously this measured approximately 34 x 24 mm. also, the center has now low attenuation suggesting cystic degeneration. no other vascular malformations are seen within the lungs. a small nodule is again noted and is unchanged in the left lung in the left upper lobe, specifically series 4a, image 62. this measures approximately 3 x 3 mm in size. no other lung nodules are identified. no pleural effusions are present. no supraclavicular or axillary adenopathy is identified. no significantly enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes are present. the main, left, and right pulmonary arteries are widely patent, extending down to several coils in the right lung which are located within the arteries supplying the av malformation. no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions identified within the skeleton. the tiny nodules in the right lower lobe are again identified and unchanged in size and appearance. please note that the inferior portion of the right lobe of liver is not included in the acquisition region.

central soft tissue filling defects in the right pulmonary artery and several of the proximal segmental branches. soft tissue opacity is also identified within the left pulmonary artery and its common basilar trunk. these findings represent acute bilateral pulmonary emboli with a larger thrombus starting in the right pulmonary artery system. thrombus is also identified in the right superior pulmonary vein. the heart is enlarged with a right ventricular predominance. there is a moderate sized pericardial effusion. there is a tiny amount of loculated fluid along the left posterior costophrenic angle and a very large right pleural effusion. associated with this pleural effusion is right lower lobe atelectasis but there is also frank right lower lobe consolidation with low density component in the center of the consolidated lung which could represent necrosis. there is no frank extraluminal air in this consolidated lung. there is atelectasis in the medial segment of the right lower lobe. no worrisome blastic or lytic bony lesions are identified. there is an incompletely imaged simple cyst in the upper pole of the left kidney. the gallbladder is now seen. the visualized portions of the spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, right kidney and liver are within normal limits. these results were discussed with the clinical team caring for the patient at approximately 2 p.m. on ___.

the pulmonary arterial tree is entirely normal. the previous small upper mediastinal hematoma has shrunk from 15 x 27 mm at the level of its greatest girth to about half its previous area, 2:26. although mediastinal lymph nodes are not grossly enlarged, virtually all visible nodes have grown, for example in the right lower paratracheal station, two nodes, 6 x 17 mm in aggregate on ___ are 10 x 21 mm today. the bronchocentric pulmonary abnormality which by conventional radiographs accelerated dramatically between ___ and today consists of both peribronchial infiltration and small nodular areas of consolidation, for example in the anterior segment of the left upper lobe, 2:37, 41, 42. there is also a generalized background abnormality of ground-glass opacification with septal thickening, more pronounced inferiorly, which is probably concurrent pulmonary edema. large areas of both lower lobes are densely atelectatic, but the bronchial tree is patent except for a small amount of secretions pooling in the mid and lower trachea. maximum cardiac diameter has increased from 124 to 133 mm. there is no pericardial effusion. a moderate volume of new bilaterial nonhemorrhagic pleural effusion layers posteriorly. the study is not designed for subdiaphragmatic evaluation except to note the resolution of previous perihepatic blood. at comparable levels, the enlarged right adrenal gland, previously 25 x 20 mm is 20 x 30 mm. although this could be a hematoma, as previously diagnosed, i following this abnormality with ultrasound to exclude an incidentally discovered mass.

heart size is normal and there are extensive atherosclerotic calcifications within the lad and left circumflex. there are calcifications at the aortic root. the ascending aorta is plaque free. again along the arch and proximal descending aorta are multiple ulcerating plaques. within the proximal descending aorta (approximately 3 cm superior to the proximal end of the graft), an ulcer appears to extend slightly beyond the wall, and may represent an early penetrating aortic ulcer, unchanged compared to the prior exam (3:43). there is a thin hypoattenuating filling defect within the aorta at this level, also unchanged, which may represent a fibrous thrombus within the lumen. the stent graft begins in the mid aorta and extends to the diaphragmatic hiatus and there is no evidence of contrast extravasation into the previously seen penetrating aortic ulcer. no evidence of endoleak. inferior to the graft again seen is ulcerating plaque within the non- aneurysmal aorta. there is a clean fat plane surrounding the aorta, with no inflammatory changes or soft tissue to suggest aortitis. small 6 to 8-mm mediastinal nodes are noted in the right paratracheal, subcarinal, and ap window nodal stations. these do not meet ct criteria for pathologic enlargement. moderate centrilobular emphysema is seen. there is a tiny left pleural effusion and focus of extrapleural fat at the left lung base which is unchanged compared to prior. lingular atelectasis is noted. no suspicious nodules or masses are seen. incidental note is made of a retrobronchial right upper lobe pulmonary venous drainage. this exam is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic assessment. there is heterogeneous enhancement of the liver, likely due to the early arterial phase of the study. two focal 4-6 mm hypodensities within the left lobe of the liver are incompletely characterized but likely represent cysts or hemangiomas. multiple incompletely imaged renal cysts are again seen. the spleen is small and atrophic. there are no bone findings of malignancy.
there are extensive ground-glass opacities bilaterally with more nodular and tree-in-___ configuration opacities seen peripherally as well, some areas of interlobular septal thickening, and diffuse but predominantly central peribronchovascular thickening. bibasilar linear opacities consistent with fibrosis which were seen on prior chest ct are largely obscured by this process. there are moderate bilateral low density pleural effusions. no mediastinal, supraclavicular, hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy identified. the airways are patent to the segmental level bilaterally. the thoracic aorta is not dilated and contains no dissection flap. ascending aorta measures 3.2 cm. descending aorta measures 2.1 cm. there is motion artifact due to non-gated image acquisition. there are coronary arterial and aortic atherosclerotic calcifications present. there is mild (<50%) stenosis of the left subclavian artery at its origin from the arch (4:12). there is no filling defect within the pulmonary arteries to suggest pulmonary embolus. the descending aorta contains extensive mixed atherosclerotic plaques with several areas of plaque ulceration (e.g. 4:73). there is no evidence of descending aortic dissection. diffuse stranding in the mediastinum is noted along with diffuse subcutaneous stranding, which may reflect anasarca. there is a small pericardial effusion. the esophagus is dilated with an air-fluid level seen through most of its thoracic course. this is unchanged from the prior studies. the imaged portion of the liver, stomach and the spleen are unremarkable. there is an exophytic 1.3-cm lesion in the upper pole of the left kidney which is hyperdense on pre-contrast images (80 ___, 4:83) and does not enhance on post-contrast images. this is slightly larger than in ___ when it measured 9 mm. the imaged portion of the axial skeleton is remarkable only for mild degenerative changes of the thoracic spine.
the patient is intubated with endotracheal tube in appropriate position. nasogastric tube terminates in the proximal duodenum. there is no evidence of mediastinal hematoma or great vessel injury. the aorta is normal in caliber without dissection or transsection. there are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes of the chest. there is mild dependent atelectasis bilaterally but otherwise the lungs are clear. there is no pleural fluid or pneumothorax.

there is no evidence of pulmonary embolism to the subsegmental levels. the aorta and great vessels are unremarkable with no evidence of acute aortic syndromes. there is extensive atherosclerotic disease involving the thoracic aorta and its major branches and the coronary arteries. re-demonstrated are extensive prominent mediastinal lymph nodes. for example, there is a subcarinal lymph node (3:49) that demonstrates interval enlargement since most recent prior examination now measuring 16 mm in transverse diameter where on prior examination it measured 10 mm. in addition, there is a right hilar lymph node (3:39) now measuring 17 mm in transverse diameter where on prior examination it measured around 9 mm. several paratracheal lymph nodes have also demonstrated interval increase in size, for example, (3:39), there is a 10-mm in short axis lymph node that is enlarged from 7 mm. in the prevascular space, there is a 13-mm in short axis lymph node that is roughly stable in size. there is no axillary adenopathy. clips are noted within the right axilla, and post-biopsy changes are noted within the right breast. re-demonstrated is severe emphysema within the lungs. subpleural scarring is noted within the right middle lobe. bibasilar reticulated pattern has increased since examination from ___ and also ___; however, there has been also interval development of patchy opacification in this region. there is no evidence of pneumothorax, pleural, or pericardial effusion. this examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation. partially imaged portions of the liver, spleen, and stomach are unremarkable.
there is no pulmonary embolism. there is no pneumothorax. left lower lobe collapse is unchanged. abnormal areas of ground glass attenuation are re- demonstrated in the left upper lobe and scattered foci in the right upper lobe. no definite endobronchial lesions are seen. right lower lobe wedge shaped opacity is unchanged in appearance, and demonstrates contrast enhancement, possibly representing an area of post- obstructive atelectasis due to mucus plugging. area of probable discoid atelectasis adjacent to the minor fissure is unchanged. multiple small mediastinal lymph nodes are again seen, but none meet ct criteria for pathologic enlargement. small left pleural effusion is unchanged. there is no right pleural effusion or pericardial effusion. heart size is normal. coronary artery calcifications are unchanged. old right rib fractures are seen, with nonunion of one of the fractures. limited views of the upper abdomen are unremarkable.
the heart and pericardium are unremarkable with resolution of previously noted pericardial effusion. no filling defects are identified in the pulmonary arteries to suggest pulmonary embolism. there is unchanged appearance of a saccular aneurysm along the inferior aspect of the descending aortic arch with intraluminal thrombus within. no intimal flap is identified to suggest dissection. evaluation of lung parenchyma demonstrates ill-defined regions of subpleural ground-glass opacity within the right upper lobe which is new since previous study. a 3-mm non-calcified pulmonary nodule is noted in the right lung apex (4:12) which is also present on previous study from ___. the major airways are patent down to the subsegmental level. no axillary, mediastinal or hilar adenopathy is present. there are bilateral small pleural effusions left greater than right with associated passive atelectasis. scarring is still present in the right upper lobe and the left lung base.
as seen previously, and unchanged, there are multiple scattered mediastinal lymph nodes, some of which are at the upper limites of normal in size. there are minimal bilateral hilar nodes, non- enlarged, and unchanged. no significant axillary nodes are seen. the heart, pericardium, and great vessels are stable. the lungs are clear without nodules, masses, or areas of consolidation. no pleural effusions.
