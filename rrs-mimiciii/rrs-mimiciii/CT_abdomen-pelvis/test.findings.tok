there is no parenchymal opacity or pleural effusion at the lung bases. heart size is normal. there is no pericardial effusion. slightly limited evaluation of solid organs due to lack of iv contrast. with this limitation in mind, the liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are within normal limits. the stomach, duodenum, and intra-abdominal loops of small bowel are unremarkable. there is no small bowel dilatation or wall thickening. there is no free fluid or free air in the abdomen. post-surgical changes in the right lower quadrant at the site of prior ostomy are noted with no evidence of fluid collection or other complication. within the left upper quadrant of the abdomen is a focal area acute diverticulitis involving the transverse colon (series 2, image 35), with surrouding fat stranding and edema. no perforation or fluid collection is noted. this area of acute diverticulitis is new from prior.

imaged lung bases demonstrate a focal area of atelectasis or scarring in the lingula which may correspond to infarct given the patient's recent history of pulmonary emboli. no pleural or pericardial effusion is seen. please note, assessment of solid and visceral organs in the abdomen is limited in the absence of intravenous contrast. the liver is hypoattenuating suggesting fatty deposition without focal lesion, intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation. the gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adjacent splenule, and right adrenal gland are unremarkable. in the left adrenal gland is an intervally decreased 12 x 9 mm area of thickening which likely reflects continuing resolution of adrenal hematoma without evidence of focal underlying lesion. the kidneys are without hydronephrosis. the imaged stomach, small and large bowel within the abdomen are unremarkable. there is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal adenopathy with a 9-mm left para-aortic node, unchanged (3:44). no free fluid or air seen in the abdomen. there is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal adenopathy.
ct abdomen without contrast: moderate bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis are present. calcifications at the cardiac apex are compatible with old myocardial infarction. within the limits of the noncontrast exam, the liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable. stones are noted within the gallbladder. oral contrast has progressed to the cecum. there is no abnormal small bowel distention or thickening. the colon is distended symmetrically without a transition point. there is no abnormal colonic wall thickening or stricture. there are large scattered amounts of stool with a bolus of stool at the rectum. there is no pneumatosis. there is no free air or ascites. scattered atheromatous calcifications are noted in the aorta and iliac arteries. no significant mesenteric or retroperitoneal adenopathy is detected.
the visualized lung bases demonstrate bibasilar atelectasis. additionally, in the left breast again seen is a 3 x 2 cm spiculated mass with nipple retraction (3:9) which appears intimately associated with the underlying pectoralis muscles. within the limits of a non-contrast study, the liver demonstrates no focal lesion or intrahepatic biliary dilatation. the gallbladder is decompressed without evidence of stones. the spleen is normal in size. the pancreas shows no masses. again, the right adrenal gland shows nodular thickening of the lateral limb (3:24) similar to prior exam. the kidneys demonstrate multiple exophytic circumscribed structures, some of which are cysts, but many of which are dense, possibly representing hemorrhagic cysts, although solid mass lesions cannot be excluded. the small and large bowel showed no evidence of obstruction or wall edema. again is noted an intramural fatty lesion of the right colon measuring 2 x 1 cm in the axial plane (3:42), most compatible with lipoma. there is no lymphadenopathy, free air, or free fluid. the aorta is of a normal caliber along its course. no retroperitoneal hematoma is present.

new small bilateral pleural effusions are identified at the lung bases, right greater than left. minimal subsegmental atelectasis is seen at the lung bases. the heart remains mildly enlarged. evaluation of the intra-abdominal viscera is limited due to the non-contrast technique and streak artifact from the spine hardware. the liver is normal in size with no definite focal lesion. prominence of the common bile duct is again noted measuring 10 mm. no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation is identified. the gallbladder, spleen, and pancreas are within normal limits and unchanged from prior. prominence of the pancreatic duct is not clearly identified on this examination likely due to technique. the adrenal glands are normal. a 3.4 x 4.5 cm cystic lesion in the upper pole of the left kidney is unchanged compared to prior. attenuation valued are indeterminate and may represent a hemorrhagic cyst. additional too small to characterize hypoattenuating lesions within both kidneys appear stable.

upon additional review of patient's record, the patient is also noted to be hiv positive. ct of the abdomen with intravenous contrast other than dependent atelectasis, the lung bases are clear with no focal consolidations, pleural effusions, or pulmonary nodules. the liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, both adrenal glands, both kidneys, both ureters, and visualized portions of intra-abdominal small and large bowel are unremarkable. there is no intra-abdominal free air or free fluid. note is made of a significant amount of fluid within the colon that may indicate a component of nonspecific fluid within the small bowel and colon that may indicate a component of enteritis. there are multiple scattered retroperitoneal lymph nodes numerous in quantity, though none that meet size criteria for pathologic enlargement.
evaluation of the abdomen is limited by lack of intravenous contrast, but there is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. note is made of pneumobilia, as seen on prior, possibly the result of prior sphincterotomy. the gallbladder is surgically absent. within the limitations of a non-contrast study, the pancreas is normal. previously described cystic mass in the tail of the pancreas is not well evaluated without contrast. the stomach contains oral contrast and is distended, the inferior portion of the stomach is not visualized as it extends below the imaged portion of the abdomen. the adrenals are normal in size bilaterally. the kidneys are normal without hydronephrosis or stones. the spleen is unremarkable. there is no intraperitoneal free fluid or free air. coarse calcification is again noted along the anterior surface of the liver. visualized aorta is normal in caliber.
