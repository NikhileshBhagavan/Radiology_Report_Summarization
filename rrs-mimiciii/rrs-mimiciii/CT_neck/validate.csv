"the patient is noted to have an endotracheal tube with tip above the carina.a nasogastric tube can be seen coursing through the esophagus.within the retropharyngeal space, there is a complex amount of material likely representing combination of fluid versus hemorrhage.local infection cannot be completely excluded, based upon imaging characteristics.the expanded polytetrafluoroethylene graft can be seen coursing posterior and inferior to the retropharyngeal space fluid, but likely within this fascial compartment.the upper portion of a descending thoracic aortic graft is visualized.no significant cervical lymphadenopathy is identified.there is minimal dependent atelectasis on the lung windows.there may be a small left apical medially-located bleb.evaluation of the neck via the bone windows reveals no fractures or abnormal lytic/blastic lesions.","heterogeneous.likely fluid collection within the retropharyngeal space likely secondary to postoperative reaction to retropharyngeal- placed carotid-to-carotid bypass.findings were discussed with dr.___ ___ over the telephone at approximately 4:30 p.m.by drs.___ and ___.apparently, by then, the et tube was removed and the patient was reported to be breathing normally."
noncontrast images are negative for intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures.slight hyperdensity within the right parietal white matter is most consistent with fine calcifications in this region.there is a 1.8 cm x 1.2 cm left parieto- occipital calcified meningioma.,"no perfusion abnormality.please note that the area of concern on subsequent mr brain is not fully covered by the limited perfusion images.no evidence of significant stenosis within the circle of ___, ___ tributaries, or head and neck vessels.three-mm saccular, narrow necked aneurysm at the origin of the anterior temporal branch of the right middle cerebral artery.minimal hyperdensity within the right parietal subcortical white matter.this is a nonspecific finding, but may be associated with mild calcifications.along with the imaging findings of the mr brain, these could represent fine calcifications associated with a low-grade glioma.18 x 12 mm left parieto-occipital meningioma.bilateral thyroid nodules."
"a large fluid-density process spans the midline in the retropharyngeal/prevertebral soft tissue space.this is indistinctly marginated and extends caudad to the level of the hyoid.cephalad, hypodensity reaches the level of the lower nasopharynx.this hypodense material also extends laterally, and appears trans-spatial, involving the carotid spaces, right more than left, to surround the jugular veins, which appear patent by opacification, bilaterally.anteriorly, there is notable involvement of the uvula, which is markedly enlarged, as well as the lingual and palatine tonsils and epiglottis (most evident on sagittal reformations).no distinct hyperenhancing rim or margin encapsulates this hypodensity.there is noteworthy narrowing of the caliber of the oro- and hypopharynx.scattered lymph nodes are present bilaterally, none of which appear significantly enlarged by ct criteria.regional vascular structures opacify normally.limited visualization of intracranial contents and of the lung apices are both unremarkable.included osseous structures are notable for cervical spinal degenerative change, but are otherwise unremarkable, without destruction.","extensive, but ill-defined edema, centered at the retropharyngeal space but extending, particularly laterally, as a trans-spatial process.there is no discrete rim- enhancing component.overall, the primary consideration is extensive phlegmon, likely related to infection.note that the absence of defined margin does not exclude the possibility of abscess.given the mass-effect of these findings, clinical correlation is recommended to assess for potential need for airway protection."
"the proximal left vertebral artery is tortuous.otherwise, the vertebral and carotid arteries are patent throughout their cervical courses, without a hemodynamically significant stenosis.the distal right internal carotid artery measures 5.6 mm in diameter.the distal left internal carotid artery measures 5.5 mm in diameter.the patient has an endotracheal tube and orogastric tube in place.the endotracheal tube terminates 2.7 cm above the carina.there is atelectasis in the imaged upper lungs, right greater than left.","subarachnoid hemorrhage in the basal cisterns with extension into the fourth ventricle.5-mm right-sided saccular aneurysm of the distal basilar artery, proximal to the superior cerebellar artery origin, which appears to be associated with the origin of a brainstem perforator artery.slight contour prominence in the proximal superior division of the right mca, possibly related to the origin of a small branch that is poorly visualized, but a small aneurysm cannot be excluded.this may be better assessed by conventional angiography, which will presumably be pursued for evaluation of the basilar aneurysm.findings were discussed with the emergency department shortly after image interpretation at 11:15 a.m.on ___."
"the lung apices are clear.there is a right subclavian central venous catheter noted.the great vessels of the neck are unremarkable.there are multiple small cervical lymph nodes, but no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes.slightly prominent bilateral jugulodigastric lymph nodes, the larger one on the right measuring 9 x 13 mm in axial dimension are probably normal.again, noted is thickening of the prevertebral soft tissues, without a discrete abscess identified, as well as thickening of the parapharyngeal tissues.the overall appearance is unchanged.the major salivary glands are within normal limits.","persistent thickening of the prevertebral and parapharyngeal soft tissues, for which correlation with clinical exam is suggested, as further details are difficult to discern by ct.no discrete fluid collection, however."
