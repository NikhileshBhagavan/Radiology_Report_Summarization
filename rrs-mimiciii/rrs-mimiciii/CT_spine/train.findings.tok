there are a few well-defined sclerotic lesions, noted in the thoracic spine, one in the anterior aspect of the t3, which measures 0.7 cm, and was barely visible on the prior torso ct sagittal reformations. similarly, a lesion noted in the posteroinferior aspect of t8 vertebral body, with minimal convexity of the posterior contour, measuring 1.2 x 1.1 cm is also more conspicuous on the present study and may be mildly increased. on the prior ct torso, the lesion approximately measures 0.6 cm. and faintly visible. in the mid t9 vertebral body, there is a 0.5 cm sclerotic focus. another two sclerotic foci were noted in the t12 vertebral body, are mildly increased in size and more conspicuous. the lesion, located in the t12 vertebral body, anteroinferiorly may relate to degenerative changes versus a neoplastic lesion. there is no cortical discontinuity. in addition, multilevel degenerative changes, were noted in the thoracic spine, with anterior and bridging osteophytes. small sclerotic focus, noted at the left costovertebral junction and the in the left 8th rib(series 3, image 49) may relate to a similar etiology. bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right and mild on the left along with associated changes in the lung parenchyma were partially imaged and better assessed, on ct chest. on the scout image, there are distended bowel loops, which have mildly increased comapred to the prior ct lumbar spine but not assessed on the present study.
reformatted images in the coronal and sagittal planes reconfirm the above mentioned findings.
as was noted on mr performed the same date, there is diffuse metastatic disease involving the thoracic spine causing ___ compression deformities. these appear to be most severe at the t2, t9, and t11 through l1 vertebral bodies. of note, a predominantly right-sided paraspinal soft tissue mass at the level of t2 is identified which involves the t2 vertebral body and appears to involve the spinal canal. although evaluation of spinal canal soft tissue detail is limited on ct, comparison mr does demonstrate possible cord compression secondary to infiltration at this level. this mass extends superiorly as a prevertebral soft tissue mass, just to the right and posterior to the trachea. it appears to extend to the level of c7, in the prevertebral soft tissues. degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are also evident with anterior osteophyte formation, predominantly at the t8 through t11 levels. posterior osteophytic changes are also noted predominantly at t11 through l1 with areas of canal stenosis at these levels. limited evaluation of intra-abdominal and retroperitoneal structures reveals a rounded approximately 1.1 cm calcific density in the region of the gallbladder neck, most likely due to cholelithiasis. limited evaluation of the visualized lung fields reveals dependent atelectasis bilaterally. previously noted t2 paraspinal mass does appear to bulge into the apex of the right lung.

there is visualization of the skull base through t2. there is straightening of the normal cervical lordosis, without evidence of fracture or paravertebral soft tissue abnormality. mild rotational displacement of c1 with respect to c2 and eccentric location of the dens with respect to the lateral masses is likely due to rotation and leftward tilted position of the patient's head. multilevel degenerative changes are noted, with joint space narrowing most notable at the c5-6 and c6-7 levels, the latter of which demonstrates subchondral sclerosis and posterior disc osteophyte formation. ct does not provide intrathecal detail as does mr, however, no gross abnormality is seen; if there is concern for spinal cord injury, mr would be recommended for further evaluation. the mastoid air cells remain well aerated. the visualized lung apices appear grossly normal.
there is a severe compression fracture at t2 with a large portion of the fractured vertebral body retropulsed into the canal causing significant central canal narrowing. in review of the outside mri on the day before, the spinal cord is moderately displaced posteriorly at that level. there is no other compression fracture seen in the cervical spine. moderate degenerative changes are noted most prominent at c5-6 level, with a calcified disc-osteophyte complex. the prevertebral soft tissues are normal. the visualized lung apices are noted with minimal-to-mild scarring. centrilobular emphysema is evident.

a fracture line tranverses the superior endplate of t6 and extends posteriorly through the vertebral body with slight retropulsion of the superior posterior portion of the body. the fracture line also appears to extend into the right pedicle. widening of the t5-6 anterior intervertebral space suggests a tear of the anterior longitudinal ligament. the t5-6 and t6-7 facet joints appear normal. however, the the combination of pedicle fracture and vertebral body fracture has disrupted the connection between the posterior elements and the remainder of the spine at t6. thus, there is effectively a three-column injury. the left t6 pedicle is intact. non-displaced fractures of the posterior aspect of the left t1 rib and possibly the posterior aspect of the right t1 rib are present. flowing osteophytes compatible with dish are present along the thoracic spine. pleural effusions are present with adjacent incompletely imaged opacities, which may represent either atelectasis or contusion.

along the anterior aspect of the cervical spinal canal, presumably in the epidural space, there is an area of soft tissue thickening which extends from the c3 through the c6 level. this soft tissue thickening causes leftward displacement of the thecal sac and spinal cord. this leftward displacement is most prominent at approximately the c5 level. these findings, most consistent with an epidural hematoma, appear unchanged in comparison to prior ct examination. however, ct is not able to provide intrathecal detail comparable to mri. would recommend mri if retained bullet fragment do not impose a contraindication to the study. there is no fracture or abnormal alignment. there is a chest tube present within the apex of the right lung. there is no evidence for pneumothorax.
