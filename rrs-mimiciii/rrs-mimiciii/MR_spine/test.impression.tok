minimal degenerative change as described above. no evidence of herniated disc.
diffuse metastatic disease of the entire spine, unchanged in distribution from the prior study. slight increase in the extent of the preexisting metastases may have occurred. significant severe spinal stenosis is grossly unchanged from the prior study and is due in most part to long standing chronic conditions; congenitally short pedicles, multiple disc protrusions, and degenerative facet joint disease. in summary, given the lack of progression of the multiple compression fractures and the stable retropulsed l5 vertebral compression, the patient's current neurological symptoms are likely to relate to underlying mechanical factors of spinal stenosis, with superimposed, but relatively stable metastatic osseous neoplastic disease.

the metastatic disease involving the l5 vertebral body is associated with considerable epidural disease which causes compression of the thecal sac and posterior displacement with bilateral foraminal extension involving both exiting l5 nerve roots, right greater than left. the extent of metastatic disease involving the right s1 vertebral body is also increased on the current examination. and the possibility of involvement of the s1 nerve roots bilaterally cannot be completely excluded. followup gadolinium-enhanced lumbar spine mri examination may be helpful with fat saturation.
spinal stenosis due to degenerative change. possible cord edema at c4/5. clinical correlation is recommended. a mr angiogram of the cervical and intracranial circulation is recommended for better evaluation of the vertebral arteries.
mild degenerative changes. limited evaluation for the intrinsic lesions of the spinal cord secondary to artifacts. suggestion of subtle signal abnormalities on the right in the upper cervical spinal cord at c1-c2 and on the left at c6 level. repeat sagittal and axial t2 weighted images would be helpful to evaluate these areas if clinically indicated. no enhancing lesions are seen.
again fracture of c5 is identified. no evidence of vertebral mal-alignment or disruption of the ligamentous structures seen. no evidence of extrinsic spinal cord compression or intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities. the fractures of the spinous processes are not apparent on this examination as mri is not sensitive for detection of small fractures not associated with bone marrow edema. small prevertebral hematoma as described above.

limited examination, as described above. the previously reported subdural hemorrhage into the cervical spinal canal does not appear to compress the cervical cord. if additional imaging of this hematoma is desired to determine its extent, then a noncontrast ct may be of value. there is some prevertebral soft tissue swelling that may also represent additional hemorrhage vs. edema.
degenerative change and l3-4 spinal stenosis. no sign of osteomyelitis or discitis of the lumbosacral spine. if there are signs of lower thoracic pain, or suspicion for infection in this region, further evaluation of the thoracic spine is advised, as the images obtained are of suboptimal diagnostic quality. dfdgf

1. comparative study demonstrating stable and unchanged multilevel degenerative changes of the lumbar spine as described above, more evident at the level of l2/l3, l4/l5, and l5/s1. 2. no frank evidence of nerve root compression is observed. mild-to-moderate spinal canal stenosis is detected at l4/l5 related with articular joint facet hypertrophy and ligamentum flavum thickening as described above.
status post spinal decompression with laminectomy. no change in appearance compared with the previous mri of ___. no definite signs of abscess formation or infection seen. clinical correlation recommended. if suspicion for infection persists, gallium/bone scan can help for further assessment.
1. congenitally narrowed spinal canal. 2. diffuse degenerative changes of the cervical spine with multilevel disc osteophyte complexes and mild disc bulges causing spinal canal stenosis at the c4/c5 and c5/c6 levels and mildly at c3/c4 level. findings appear more prominent than on the prior study. there is, however, no cord compression.
