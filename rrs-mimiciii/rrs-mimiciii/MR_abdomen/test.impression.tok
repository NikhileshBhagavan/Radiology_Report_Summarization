2 cm soft tissue density in the pancreatic head region causing mass effect on the adjacent common bile duct, with associated marked intra and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, cystic duct dilatation, and cystic dilatation of the pancreatic duct and side branches. this soft tissue density is not well characterized due to respiratory motion. since prior ct study of ___ demonstrated pancreatic calcifications, suggestive of chronic pancreatitis, this focal area of soft tissue density could represent focal chronic pancreatitis or obstructive neoplasm, such as pancreatic endocarcinoma or a duodenal neoplasm, such as ampullary ca. the gallbladder is contracted, containing multiple gallstones. there is no evidence of significant abdominal lymphadenopathy. further evaluation can be obtained by ercp, considering the patient's abnormal renal function. small atrophic kidneys containing multiple cysts.

1. several foci of sludge and possibly gallstones within the common bile duct are present, as are findings suggestive of inflammation of the major papilla. these findings are likely contributory to the patient's intra- and extra- hepatic ductal dilatation. ercp may be useful for further evaluation/treatment. 2. cholelithiasis and chronic cholecystitis. 3. two hypovascular lesions, right lobe of liver worrisome for neoplasm, most likely metastatic disease. 4. findings suggestive of chronic pancreatitis. no pancreatic mass is identified.

1. subtle area of increased stir signal primarily within segment 2 of the liver which is likely artifactual. although no definite abnormality is identified in the liver to suggest embolic disease, correlation with lfts is recommended and if these serum measures indicate an abnormality, then further evaluation of the liver with ct examination could be performed. 2. no evidence of embolic disease in the remainder of the abdominal organs.

1. cystic lesion in the head of the pancreas. a focal nodule in the posterior aspect of this lesion is concerning for malignancy. however, post- contrast images failed to demonstrate enhancement in this area, possibly due to limited technique. these findings should be further investigated with endoscopic ultrasound. alternatively, a pancreatic cta protocol could be performed. 2. multiple small cysts in the tail of the pancreas. these may represent dilated side branches or sequela from prior pancreatitis. multifocal side branch ipmt cannot be excluded. there is no dilatation of the main pancreatic duct. 3. bilateral atrophic kidneys. 4. gallstones.
no evidence of metastatic disease in the visualized abdomen.
1. significant interval enlargement of the previously identified hepatic mass, which demonstrates minimal enhancement. given the presence of a new nodule within the right hepatic lobe and the patient's underlying cirrhosis, these findings raise concern for hepatocellular carcinoma, though the enhancement pattern is unusual. alternatively, given the presence of vessels coursing through this mass, a soft lesion such as lymphoma is within the differential diagnosis. we would recommend a repeat ultrasound-guided biopsy of this lesion. 2. findings compatible with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. 3. ascites. 4. new intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.

no abscess is visualized within the liver. no abnormal collections are visualized within the abdomen and pelvis.
1. 1.8 cm left upper pole renal mass. a urology consult should be considered. given the stability over the past year, a followup mri could be performed in six months to one year. 2. normal-sized kidneys with innumerable renal cysts, likely related to hemodialysis. however, if clinical history is appropriate, consideration should also be given to lithium toxicity. 3. stable perihepatic ascites. 4. splenomegaly with nonspecific, nonenhancing lesions which may represent atypical infarcts. 5. stable enlarged retroperitoneal nodes.

1. biliary-excreted contrast is seen within the intrahepatic bile ducts, and within the fluid of the air-fluid levels seen at the hepatic hilum, consistent with a biliary-enteric anastomosis. however, we are unable to further delineate the biliary tree anatomy, and we did not see conventional anatomic configuration of the common bile duct or common hepatic duct is seen. 2. the t1-hyperintense rounded focus seen on the pre-gadolinium images performed yesterday is not identified today, although we are uncertain whether this is secondary to transit of this focus through bowel or if it is obscured due to signal-noise and motion limitations of the study. 3. direct injection of the biliary catheter, with corresponding cross- sectional imaging, might provide additional value. findings were discussed with dr. ___ on ___.
1. widely patent aortobifemoral graft with expected narrowing at distal anastomosis. note that there is retrograde flow within the left native artery, with a 2 cm aneurysm in the expected location of the hypogastric artery. 2. no significant disease within the lower extremities; though the dorsalis pedis arteries are not visualized on this examination. 3. left renal artery stent prohibits evaluation of the left renal artery.

bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, left greater than right. no suspicious adrenal lesions are seen.
1) soft tissue mass within the duodenum causing dilatation of the distal common bile duct. it is unclear, on this examination, if this mass arises from the ampulla or duodenal wall. further evaluation of the distal cbd and pancreatic ducts should be performed with ercp. however, if the sphincter cannot be assessed via ercp, mr imaging of this region could be performed following duodenal distention with oral contrast (water). 2) pneumobilia; this may be related to a prior procedure, such as sphincterotomy. 3) cholecystectomy. 4) findings consistent with chronic pancreatitis. 5) hemosiderosis. 6) incompletely characterized left lower pole renal mass. it is felt that calcifications are causing the decreased signal on both t1 and t2-weighted images. noncontrast ct would be helpful to confirm the presence of calcification.
