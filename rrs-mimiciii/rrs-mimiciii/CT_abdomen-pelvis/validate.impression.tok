1. improvement in left lower lobe pneumonia without complete resolution. 2. improvement in right lower lobe atelectasis without complete resolution. 3. fluid collection in the surgical bed is stable; however, margins are difficult to evaluate due to lack of iv contrast. 4. no new fluid collections noted.
1. no evidence of acute or impending aortic rupture of a known abdominal aortic aneurysm. 2. gallstone without evidence of cholecystitis, the gallbladder is collapsed. 3. anterior abdominal wall varices, described previously. 4. interval increase in bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right.
no evidence of diverticulitis. several dilated small bowel loops are seen in the upper abdomen but no evidence of obstruction, as contrast passes freely into the descending colon.
1. interval decrease in the size of the two subhepatic fluid collections. jp drains in place and small residual fluid, free air and stranding. the jp drains appear to be in good position. 2. interval increase in the anasarca with increased amount of free fluid in the pelvis.

continued wall thickening of the ascending colon consistent with colitis with probable slight improvement in overall extent, however. otherwise, no significant change since prior study.
1. this scan is limited in terms of evaluating vascular structures or looking for abscesses due to the lack of intravenous contrast as well as streak artifact from overlying hardware. 2. however, there is a hypoattenuating region consistent with subdiaphragmatic hematoma superior to the liver as well as hypoattenuating regions consistent with foci of hemorrhage/clotting adjacent to the liver. these findings should be correlated clinically. 3. hypoattenuation of the inferior vena cava is noted from the intrahepatic portion to the base of the right atrium. this might represent a vena caval clot , but given the limitations of the exam as noted previously, this could be a technical artifact. please correlate clinically; mri (either without or with contrast) could be performed to more definitively regions of subdiaphragmatic hematoma and vascular patency as indicated. 4. presence of right pleural effusion remains unchanged. there is also atelectasis with possible overlying pneumonia in the proper clinical setting at the left lower lobe. these findings were discussed with dr. ___ ___ of the patient's primary clinical team at approximately 3 p.m. on ___.
1. limited exam secondary to lack of intravenous and oral contrast. massive amount of ascites as well as capsular hepatic fluid collection are stable. 2. new nodular opacities within the left lung base, which may represent focal air space disease. 3. the pancreas, spleen, kidneys, and intra-abdominal loops of large and small bowel are not well evaluated on this exam. 4. status post pseudocyst-gastrostomy with stable appearance of pancreatic pseudocyst

1. bibasilar consolidations, right more than left. 2. no evidence of intra-abdominal source of fever. 3. fatty liver
1) right lower lobe pneumonia.
1. cirrhosis with eosphageal varices, moderate ascites and splenomegaly. 2. distended gallbladder with mural thickening and pericholecystic fluid likely secondary to liver disease. given that no gallstones were seen on the recent abdominal us, the likelihood of primary gb process is unlikely though clincial correlation is advised. 3. sigmoid colon diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
1. a large hematoma in the right thigh. see the dictation on lower extremity ct scan done on the same day. 2. fat stranding surrounding the right femoral region without clear connection to the hematoma. this could be related to any recent procedure in this area. 3. irregularity of upper pole of right kidney. this cannot be accurately characterized by ct without contrast. if concern for a mass exists, recommend mr ___ ___, 4. small liver this could represent cirrhosis or congenital variant. 5. bilateral pleural effusions.

1. progression of disease with multiple new metastatic lesions involving the liver and peritoneal implants laterally. also marked progression of pelvic sidewall metastatic implants. 2. this progression is not reflected in the size of the target lesions which are approximately stable. 3. slightly more mass effect on the renal veins bilaterally by the main conglomerate mass despite stable size.
1. somewhat nodular in contour liver, suggesting underlying cirrhosis. nonspecific hypodensities at the dome of the right lobe are noted. given possible underlying cirrhosis, these should be evaluated with mri nonemergently to exclude malignancy. 2. large stone in the gallbladder, as well as air seen within the common duct and gallbladder neck. if there is no history of prior sphincterotomy, this is concerning for biliary-enteric fistula. possible fistulous connection is identified on coronal images (300b:22-23). 3. diffuse dilation of fluid-filled proximal small bowel measuring nearly 4 cm, with relative collapse of the terminal ileum and distal ileum. this is suggestive of early versus partial small-bowel obstruction, though no definite transition point is identified. 4. consolidation at the right lung base, likely atelectasis or aspiration. however, followup imaging following resolution of acute illness to exclude underlying lesion is recommended. 5. ivc filter is identified in adequate position. 6. delayed contrast excretion by the kidneys bilaterally, compatible with known renal failure. findings were discussed with dr. ___ ___ in the emergency department at the time of dictation by dr. ___ ___.

1. subcapsular splenic hematoma, measuring 13 x 6 x 10 cm in size. comparison to a prior outside study is not possible as the films are not available. 2. encapsulated fluid collection at the anastomotic site of the hemicolectomy most likely representing a post-surgical lymphocele, less likely abscess 3. multiple small bilateral renal lesions too small to characterize, likely representing cysts.
patient's abdominal pain most likely corresponds to small hematoma located just deep to the tract from the jp drain. there is no evidence of free air or large fluid collection.
1. enlarged, necrotic appearing right hilar lymph nodes measuring up to 2.6 mm. these appear accessible via transbronchial biopsy. no pulmonary mass or nodules. 2. mild intrahepatic, extrahepatic and pancreatic ductal dilatation with hypoattenuating mass in the neck of the pancreas measuring 2 cm. second hypoattenuating lesion in the tail of the pancreas measures 9 mm. these are adjacent to the dilated pancreatic duct and may represent ipmt. alternatively, attenuation characteristics suggest possible serous or mucinous tumor, particularly in the pancreatic neck. the hypoattenuating lesions in the pancreas do not account for the degree of biliary dilatation and no discrete mass is identified in the ampullary region or duodenum. ercp with possible eus recommended for further assessment. 3. enlarged thyroid gland with hypoattenuating 1.9-cm nodule in the left lobe. nodular contour of the enlarged isthmus. thyroid ultrasound would be beneficial for further characterization. 4. scattered retroperitoneal lymph nodes and left axillary lymph nodes which are borderline enlarged. 5. this study is not optimally timed for evaluation of the pulmonary arteries; questionable filling defect in left upper lobe segmental branch may represent volume averaging. if high clinical suspicion is present for pulmonary embolus, lower extremity doppler may prove beneficial. deep pelvic and common femoral veins appear patent.
1. unchanged right middle and left lower lobe small pulmonary nodules from ___, which do not require further followup. 2. enlarged main pulmonary arteries suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension. 3. small amount of ascites. 4. right shoulder effusion. 5. diverticulosis, no evidence for diverticulitis. 6. renal osteodystrophy.
1. short segment of abnormal bowel extending from the distal descending colon to the proximal sigmoid colon with mild wall thickening and surrounding inflammatory changes. given the fact that there are sigmoid diverticula noted and multiple diverticula present at this level on the patient's prior ct scan, the appearance is most consistent with diverticulitis. there is no evidence of abscess collection or perforation. differential diagnosis includes focal ischemia. 2. multiple postsurgical changes including small bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis, small amount of fluid in the abdomen and pelvis as well as the presence of a widely patent fem-fem bypass graft. 3. enhancing lesion in the left atrophic kidney. while this could represent an island of preserved renal parenchyma a renal mass cannot be excluded and mri is recommended for further evaluation.
