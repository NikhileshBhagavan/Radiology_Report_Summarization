ct angiography of the neck demonstrates exuberant calcification with occlusion of the left internal carotid artery beyond bifurcation. there are exuberant calcifications seen at the right internal carotid artery with approximately 40-50% stenosis. both vertebral arteries are patent, but calcifications seen near the origins. evaluation of the intracranial arteries demonstrates a thrombus in the region of left middle cerebral artery, which is seen as a filling defect extending from the m1 segment to the inferior division. the right middle cerebral artery, both anterior cerebral arteries and posterior circulation appear normal without evidence of stenosis or occlusion.
there is less gas within the fluid collection in the right side of the neck than on the previous examination. the size is very similar with its maximal extent being at the mid-level of the thyroid gland measuring 43 x 22 mm in cross-sectional dimension. as noted previously the left internal jugular vein is diminutive though patent. the right appears to be intermittently occluded. a tracheostomy device is in position.
endotracheal tube terminates 4 cm above the carina, and nasogastric tube courses in expected position. there are extensive retained secretions in the trachea; along with lack of intravenous contrast, this precludes evaluation of the hypopharyngeal and laryngeal structures, including the true vocal cords. however, there appears to be relative caliber transition of the hypopharynx and extrathoracic trachea, secondary to moderate retropharyngeal edema. no eccentric or circumferential constricting lesions are identified. there is mild mucosal thickening of multiple ethmoid air cells. note is made of a right maxillary uncinectomy. there is new complete opacification of the bilateral mastoids, as well as fluid in the middle ear cavities. calcifications noted in the bilateral cavernous carotid arteries. there are multilevel anterior osteophytes in the cervical spine, with mild facet and uncovertebral joint hypertrophy, but no significant canal or foraminal stenosis. cervical lymph nodes are not pathologically enlarged. dense calcifications are noted at the bilateral carotid bifurcations. probable left internal jugular venous varix. right internal jugular catheter terminates in the right brachiocephalic vein, 2 cm above the brachiocephalic/svc confluence. there are dense calcifications throughout the aortic arch and branch vessels, as well as the imaged left anterior descending coronary artery and diagonal branches. bilateral dependent atelectasis is noted in the lungs, with moderate layering effusion on the left. there is bowing of the posterior tracheal membrane, which could reflect tracheomalacia in the correct clinical setting.
the partially imaged brain and orbits are unremarkable. the visible paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated. again noted in the left peritonsillar area is a heterogenous soft tissue phlegmon. the adjacent vessels are patent, although there is narrowing of the adjacent nasopharynx. mildly prominent lymph nodes are noted at multiple levels within the neck. additionally, just superior to the posterior ring of the coracoid, there is an area of fluid attenuation posteriorly with rim enhancement, which likely represents a second area of infection. the thyroid gland is unremarkable. partially imaged lungs are normal. the visible bones are normal and no other areas of infection are noted.
visualized lung apices demonstrate dependent bibasilar atelectatic changes. multifocal calcifications of the aortic arch and descending aorta are noted. the great vessels are patent proximally. there are multifocal eccentric calcifications involving both subclavian arteries, however, they remain patent. there may be some stenosis of the proximal right subclavian but this is indefinite. scattered calcified plaque involving both common carotid arteries is present, with visible stenosis of the left common carotid artery just proximal to the bifurcation. there is 60% stenosis of the origin of the right internal carotid artery and 50% stenosis of the origin of the left internal carotid artery. visualized portions of the common carotid artery are patent bilaterally. as described in the ct of the brain, there is a dominant left vertebral artery. there is a moderate stenosis of the v4 section of the right vertebral artery. visualized soft tissues are notable for two 1 cm right paratracheal lymph nodes as well as tiny scattered bilateral cervical lymph nodes, none of which meet ct criteria for pathological enlargement. osseous structures are unremarkable.
the previously identified low-attenuation collection within the retropharyngeal soft tissues of the neck appears stable compared to ___. for example in series 2, image 32, a hypodense collection measuring approximately 23 x 8 mm is unchanged in size compared to two days prior when it measured 21 x 8 mm. previously identified hypodensity within the right pharyngeal tonsil is not clearly identified today. this retropharyngeal collection does appear to shift to the larynx anteriorly and to the right, as the collection superiorly is left sided. again, no clear rim enhancement is identified. the upper esophagus appears to course adjacent to this low- density collection and the upper most portion of the upper esophagus is not distinguishable. multiple small lymph nodes are again identified in the neck, measuring up to 8 mm and stable in size. major vascular structures are unremarkable and the lung apices are again clear. osseous structures are unremarkable. moderate mucosal thickening of the right maxillary sinus is stable. the remainder of the paranasal sinuses and visualized mastoid air cells are unremarkable.
in comparison to prior study from ___, there is little interval change. two upper left neck drains are again visualized in the parapharyngeal space with the upper drain slightly retracted to be located anterior to the carotid and the lower neck drain stable in position between the left internal jugular and common carotid at the level of the lower pole of the thyroid gland. the amount of soft tissue stranding and retropharyngeal fluid at the level of the hyoid bone appear stable (2:46). additionally, thickening of the epiglottis and left aryepiglottic fold with effacement of the left piriform sinus appears stable. supraglottic soft tissue and edema narrowing the airway is again noted and appears unchanged compared to prior study. again noted is soft tissue stranding and edema involving the left sternocleidomastoid muscle. some of the venous tributaries are not well seen; there is narrowing of the left internal jugular vein. assessment of the carotid arteries is limited. multiple small nodes are noted, some of which are enlarged. new bilateral moderate pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis are noted.
comparison is made to a prior ct of the neck from ___. again seen is nonenhancement of the right internal jugular vein with intraluminal thrombus essentially extending from the left subclavian vein cephalad up to the skull base. nonenhancement of the left sigmoid sinus is also seen, suggestive of thrombus involvement. there are no abscesses within the neck. the parotid glands appear normal and symmetric. again seen is stranding of the fat surrounding the thrombosed left internal jugular vein, not significantly changed since the prior study. also again seen are multiple small lymph nodes throughout the neck, worse on the left side. of note, the left level v lymph nodes are not significantly changed in size. there are bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusions and ground-glass densities of the right lung apex as before. no suspicious bony abnormalities are seen.
the neck arterial vessels are normally opacified. calcifications are present in the carotid bulbs bilaterally. the visualized portions of the thoracic aorta reveal wall calcification.
again noted is the large anterior mediastinal mass displacing and encasing the aortic arch and the arch vessels as well as the superior vena cava which is narrowed and partially visualized on the present study. iv contrast was injected through the left side. there is dense enhancement of the vessels on the left side including multiple collaterals, epidural veins as well as the transverse sinuses. there is extension of the mass into the supraclavicular region, approximately 2.5-3 cm into the supraclavicular region and lower part of the neck, along the lateral aspect of the left lobe of the thyroid. endotracheal tube and endobronchial stent are noted in situ. hence, it is difficult to evaluate tracheal anatomy and effect of the mass on the trachea in the neck. there are scattered multiple lymph nodes in both sides of the neck, the largest in the right level 2a, measuring 1.5 cm in the long axis (series 3, image 243). no osseous or sclerotic lesions are noted in the visualized bones. there is moderate opacification of the right maxillary and sphenoid sinuses. area of vague enhancement noted in the cervical spinal cord at c2-3 level, could be artifactual, likely from enhancement related to the abnormal collaterals. the visualized portions of the lungs reveal multiple nodules, incompletely evaluated on the present study.
there is moderate degree of sclerosis within the aortic arch, without hemodynamically significant stenosis at the origins of the great vessels. the right common carotid artery is unremarkable until its bifurcation, where there is a partially calcified atherosclerotic plaque. the right internal carotid artery is occluded throughout its course. the flow reconstitutes at the level of the bifurcation into m1 and a1 segments and is maintained in the more distal branches. there is a 3-cm long stent in the distal left common carotid artery, extending into the proximal internal carotid artery. the flow through the stented segment is maintained, and there is no hemodynamically significant stenosis at the level of the bifurcation or throughout the course of the internal carotid artery. there is approximately 3-mm inferomedially directed aneurysm, with a 2-mm neck, originating from the supraclinoid portion of the internal carotid artery. the a1 and m1 and the more distal branches are within normal limits. both vertebral arteries are patent, without occlusions or hemodynamically significant stenosis. the left vertebral artery arises directly from the aortic arch. the right vertebral artery is dominant. there is no evidence of a vascular malformation. there is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, large acute territorial infarct, shift of midline structures, or areas of abnormal enhancement within the brain. there is evidence of chronic microvascular ischemic change in the periventricular supratentorial white matter as well as several chronic lacunes in the right basal ganglia region. the soft tissues of the neck and the included upper thorax are grossly within normal limits. there is a cervical spondylosis. no suspicious osseous lesion is seen. the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
