heart and great vessels appear unremarkable and the lungs are clear without evidence of pneumothorax.there is mild bilateral dependent atelectasis.no pleural or pericardial effusion identified.no pathologically enlarged central or axillary lymph nodes are identified.there is a marked amount of prevertebral soft tissue swelling noted at the level of c7 and t1 from known underlying fracture-dislocation at this level.,"c7 and t1 fracture dislocation better described on dedicated c- spine report.no evidence of thoracic, abdominal or pelvis traumatic injury.cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis."
two lines enter via the left internal jugular and right subclavian veins and terminate in the left brachiocephalic vein.an endotracheal and nasogastric tube are noted.the heart and great vessels are unremarkable.there are large bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis.there are no lung nodules.there are no enlarged mediastinal or axillary lymph nodes.,moderate intraabdominal ascites without abscess.large bilateral pleural effusions.right subclavian and left ij lines both terminate in the left brachiocephalic vein.
