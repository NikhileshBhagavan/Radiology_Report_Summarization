1. left parietal/frontal parenchymal mass, 3.6x2.6cm, with significant surrounding edema and mass effect on the left lateral ventricle. the appearance suggests a rind of tumor with a small region of necrosis centrally. this could represent a metastasis or primary brain neoplasm . rec. neurosurgical consult and close followup if no intervention is contemplated. 2. tiny outpouchings from the cavenrous carotid segments on both sides- consider tof mra head for better assessment.
1. comparative study, status post resection of a left parietal meningioma, the previously described area of restricted diffusion in the left parietal lobe is no longer visualized; today, examination demonstrates an area of encephalomalacia and blood products remaining in the surgical bed. 2. there is evidence of enhancement in the surgical area, raising the possibility of post-surgical dural enhancement and scar tissue; however, there is a small ring enhancing area measuring approximately 6.8 x 20.9 mm which raises the possibility of a small non-resolved hematoma. followup is recommended in three to six months or as clinically indicated. moderate ventriculomegaly and periventricular hyperintensities are again noted and unchanged since the prior examination. these findings were reported to the primary team neurology/neuro- oncology/brain tumor, dr. ___ ___ at 11:05 hours. dr. ___ ___

1. 4 cm left cerebellar and 1 cm right cerebellar masses which are partially calcified on ct images. this could be secondary to metastasis such as a colloid carcinoma of colon or due to hemangioblastoma as clinically suspected. 2. left parietal extra-axial appearing mass is incompletely evaluated and could be due to an additional metastasis in the cortical surface or due to a meningioma. further evaluation with repeat gadolinium-enhanced study is recommended. the gadolinium-enhanced study could not be obtained during this examination as patient was unable to continue.
progression of intracranial metastases with multiple new and enlarging cerebral and cerebellar lesions as mentioned above. metastases within the posterior right occipital lobe and left cerebellum have considerable new vasogenic edema.

given the fact that the patient has several risk factors for vascular disease and that is process involves the cortex, the most likely diagnosis is an acute/subacute infarct. however, ring enhancement is not typically seen in the presence of an infarction. therefore, recommend repeating the ct in 2 weeks to confirm this impression, by virtue of evolution of an infarct to chronicity.
moderate brain and medial temporal atrophy. mild changes of small vessel disease. no evidence of territorial infarcts.
unchanged mild left hippocampus atrophy.
1. stable right parietal tumor. this likely represents high-grade malignancy such as glioblastoma multiforme or metastasis. 2. stable left parietal parasagittal extra-axial mass likely representing meningioma.

compared to recent exam from ___, the mass in the right frontal lobe has increased in size. given its overall appearance, the prime differential diagnostic consideration remains primary glial neoplasm; however, the component of restricted diffusion within its caudal portion would be atypical, and raises possibility of other pathology characterized by hypercellularity, such as cns lymphoma (though cystic necrosis would be unusual).
1. acute widespread infarcts involving the bilateral anterior and posterior circulation as detailed above. there is no associated vascular occlusion, no mass effect or hemorrhagic transformation. relative global reduction in flow related enhancement of the left intracranial ica and mca may indicate a flow limiting stenosis in the cervical portion of the left ica. 2. extensive sequela of small vessel ischemic disease. 3. fluid retention in the sphenoid sinus as well as bilateral opacification of the mastoid air cells, likely related to intubation. comment: the findings were discussed with dr. ___ ___ by dr. ___ (___ at 2 pm).

no significant change compared to one day prior. stable right frontal hematoma and scattered cortical infarctions. the differential again includes embolic infarctions versus amyloid disease.
scattered increased t2 signal in the supratentorial white matter. this can be seen in the setting of small vessel ischemic disease; however, demyelination, post inflammatory process or vasculitis related changes can have the similar appearance. a contrasted study may be of some benefit for further evaluation but may not be confirmatory. clinical and lab correlation can also be helpful.

1. extensive areas of t2 and flair hyperintensity centered in the right frontal lobe, but extending to involve the parietal and temporal lobes as well as the brainstem and cerebellum. the overall extent of involvement is stable in configuration since the prior study. the front of contrast enhancement has resolved, which may reflect suppression of the inflammatory response secondary to the treatment. these findings are suggestive of an aggressive demyelinating process. 2. while the degree of mass effect on the right lateral ventricle is increased since ___, there is stable leftward midline shift and slight decrease in the degree of right uncal herniation. 3. new focus of decreased diffusion involving the right occipital lobe with increased t2/flair hyperintensity involving the cortex more than the white matter. the appearance is different and discontinuous from the lesion centered in the right frontal lobe, and may represent an acute infarct. this could be secondary to compromise of the right posterior cerebral artery by mass effect related to the right uncal herniation, versus a thromboembolic phenomenon.
study performed demonstrating left frontal metastatic lesion, which has increased in size compared to ___. vasogenic edema has also increased. no new lesions are identified.
sinus disease. otherwise negative study. no specific evidence of restricted diffusion.
radiographic worsening of the left medial temporal lobe mass. considering the increased area of enhancement and surrounding edema, there is concern for conversion of the anaplastic astrocytoma to a glioblastoma. this is less likely to represent radiation necrosis and correlation with timing of radiation therapy is recommended.

1. multifocal regions of abnormally decreased diffusion, most prominent within the right frontal lobe, which has an appearance suggestive of watershed infarction. the more punctate foci of decreased diffusion posteriorly suggest multiple small emboli. 2. well-defined 15 mm focus of enhancement and decreased diffusion within the right cerebellar hemisphere may represent a subacute enhancing infarct, but is more concerning for a metastatic lesion in this patient with lung cancer. consideration could be given to neck mra or cta to evaluate the cervical circulation, though the pattern suggests a proximal source. the findings were paged to the clinical service, dr. ___ ___ at the time of dictation, 0915 hours on ___.
stable appearance of brain compared to previous exam of ___. no enhancing masses are detected. there is prominent vascular enhancement throughout the intracranial space, the etiology and significance of which is uncertain. perhaps this is related to the patient's renal insufficiency and poor clearance of contrast. meningitis cannot be excluded and lumbar puncture should be considered for further clinical evaluation.
slight increase in nodular enhancement along the margins of the postoperative cavity including a more focal lesion in the superior lateral margin of the cavity. ___ recurrence cannot be excluded although some of these findings may represent post-treatment sequela. recommend attention on short-term followup imaging.

since the previous mri of ___, the left sided vestibular schwannoma has considerably increased in size, now measures approximately 4 x 3.1 cm in size compared to 1 cm seen previously. there is increased mass effect, deformity of the fourth ventricle and edema in cerebellum without hydrocephalus. the findings were discussed with dr. ___ at the time of interpretation of this study on ___ at 5 p.m.
1. large, predominantly enhancing intra-axial mass in th inferior aspect of the right frontal lobe. this demonstrates internal cystic necrosis, intratumoral hemorrhage and slow diffusion and likely represents a high-grade primary glial neoplasm. given the avid enhancement and slow diffusion, primary cns lymphoma is an additional consideration; however, the relatively peripheral location, as well as the cystic necrosis and hemorrhage would be unusual. a solitary metastatic lesion is a more remote possibility. 2. associated vasogenic edema, but only minimal mass effect on the subjacent lateral ventricle and no evidence of central herniation.

limited enhanced study for surgical planning, re-demonstrating the extra-axial lesion centered in the left meckel cave. the overall imaging appearance, including its rounded, bilobed appearance and early extension into the foramen ovale, favors a primary nerve sheath tumor, likely schwannoma, probably of trigeminal nerve origin.
1. enhancing soft tissue lesion at the skull base, surrounding the dens, with pre-contrast signal characteristics most consistent with fibrous tissue, including central focus of hypoenhancement. this appearance might be seen with crystalline arthropathy such as cppd arthropathy, with pannus secondary to an inflammatory arthritis such as rheumatoid or one of its variants (thought the pattern of dorsal involvement is atypical), or "pseudo- pannus" due to osteoarthritis. though there are erosive changes in the dens, pyogenic infection is considered less likely, as there is no visible fluid signal centrally; relatively "indolent" infection is an additional consideration. lymphomatous involvement of the dura is a more remote possibility, particularly given that the patient has been ___ for several years, and also would also not readily explain the central hypoenhancement. 2. subacute infarction in the right midbrain, in the region of the periaqueductal white matter and median longitudinal fasciculus, likely explaining the recent symptoms. 3. extensive small vessel ischemic disease, atrophy, and old left frontotemporal infarct with likely prior laminar necrosis and dystrophic mineralization.

1. post-surgical changes from resection of the right frontal hemorrhagic region with resection bed enhancememt. no definite underlying mass noted. however may be confounded by post-operative enhancement. continued follow-up given history of melanoma is recommended. 2. unchanged left superior frontal susceptibility possibly reflecting subarachnoid hemorrhage with post- hemorrhagic siderosis. 3. right posterior occipital punctate susceptibility, likely amyloid angiopathy related microbleeds, stable.
unremarkable head mra. incidental note is made of termination of right vertebral artery in pica.
markedly limited study with motion. right frontal and parietal hematomas. subtle peripheral increased intensity on this post-gadolinium images could be due to enhancement or could be due to blood products in the right parietal region. consider a repeat study with pre and post-gadolinium jmages for better assessment, if clinically indicated.
1) there is no evidence of a lesion underlying the original hematoma, in the right frontal lobe. 2) bifrontal parenchymal hemorrhages and intraventricular hemorrhage are stable compared to the ct of the same day 3)there is no change in ventricular size with a left-sided ventricular drain in place.
1. stable appearance of two foci of susceptibility, one within the cerebellum and one within the right occipital lobe. these are consistent with prior episodes of intracranial hemorrhage. 2. no evidence of new foci of hemorrhage. no evidence of acute or subacute infarction.
1. previously noted area of increased signal in bilateral thalami on the diffusion-weighted images is no longer noted and appears to have been artifactual. 2. no acute infarcts. 3. extensive sinus disease as well as bilateral mastoiditis. 4. stenosis of the distal right vertebral artery.
1. multiple small areas of flair white matter hyperintensities in keeping with old infarcts on a background of moderate microangiopathic small vessel disease. no acute infarct or intracranial hemorrhage. 2. stable appearances of mucous retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus.
right parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with no significant change compared to same day ct. underlying lesion cannot be excluded. followup is recommended.
1. large organized hematomas involving the temporoparietal lobes, bilaterally, with prominent "hematocrit effect" and relatively little in the way of associated vasogenic edema. if this represents layering hemorrhage at the very time of presentation, this is highly suggestive of either anticoagulation or underlying coagulopathy. 2. such a presentation may be occasionally be seen with underlying amyloid angiopathy, which might also explain the associated regional subarachnoid hemorrhage, related to involvement of the overlying pial vessels. however, cerebral amyloidosis would be unusual in a patient of this age, and there is no evidence of microbleeds, elsewhere. 3. no pathologic or mass-like enhancement around the lesions, or elsewhere in the brain, to specifically suggest underlying neoplastic process. 4. no abnormal vessel is associated with the hemorrhages. 5. lesions demonstrate a rim of apparent restricted diffusion; however, the overall appearance makes hemorrhagic transformation of underlying infarctions quite unlikely. such an appearance, with cytotoxic edema, can be seen with hemorrhagic cortical/subcortical contusions, and trauma could account for the accompanying subarachnoid hemorrhage; this should be closely correlated with any other clinical evidence of recent trauma. 6. unremarkable cranial mrv with no evidence of cerebral venous thrombosis. 7. apparent chronic occlusion of the left internal carotid artery from the skull base through its terminus, with reconstitution largely via a robust posterior communicating artery; this raises the possibility that the patient has been anticoagulated for chronic carotid disease, leading to the presentation, above. depending on the clinical scenario, dedicated imaging of the cervical vessels with either mra or cta may be warranted.
1. redemonstration of the previously noted homogeneously enhancing lesion in the right middle cranial fossa, likely dural-based, measuring 2.2 x 1.6 cm and may represent a meningioma/dural-based neoplastic lesion such as metastasis/lymphoma also in the differential diagnosis. follow up as clinically indicated.
interval development of new small foci of signal abnormalities with mild surrounding edema indicative of metastatic disease involving both cerebral hemispheres and small new lesions in the cerebellar hemispheres. several of these lesions demonstrate blood products but no evidence of large cerebral hematoma is identified. no mid-line shift or hydrocephalus. other changes as above.
1. status post suboccipital decompression with stable ventriculomegaly, low lying tonsils, and mild posterior kinking of medulla near the cervicocranial junction, compatible with chiari i malformation. 2. persistent nonvisualization of the cerebral aqueduct. 3. anterior predominant csf motion about the medulla. 4. stable caliber of symmetric ventriculomegaly. 5. increasing conspicuity and contiguity of the upper cervical syrinx as compared to ___.

no evidence of encephalitis. decreased signal intensity in the clivus consistent with myelomatous infiltration. no other changes compared to ___, ___.
1. punctate areas of susceptibility artifacts scattered throughout the subcortical white matter, most compatible with amyloid angiopathy. less likely are small hemorrhagic metastases, which should only be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. 2. severe chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
post-surgical changes from resection of left temporal cavernoma. artifact from surgical material somewhat limits evaluation in the lateral left temporal lobe; however, there is no evidence of new or recurrent lesion.
limited mra of the circle of ___ by motion artifact reveals probable worsening moderate to severe stenosis of the left m1 segment of the mca and mild to moderate stenosis of the right m1 portion of the mca. there is attenuated flow along the middle cerebral artery trifurcations, left worse than right in addition to moderate disease involving the cavernous ica's. no acute territorial infarcts are seen within the brain. the basilar artery is unremarkable. further followup is suggested based on clinical grounds.
1. status post right craniectomy for a right parietal mass excision with a small amount of hemorrhagic material within the post-surgical cavity. 2. minimal perilesional flair signal abnormality which when compared to the preoperative examination raises the possibility of residual tumor both anterior, and posterior to the surgical cavity. however, the regions that enhanced preoperatively do appear to have been resected. 3. right hemispheric dural thickening and enhancement, likely postoperative.
pre-operative mri demonstrates grossly unchanged minimally enhancing right frontal mass. fiducial markers are in place.
stable postoperative changes with stable enhancement involving the right frontal lobe, septum pellucidum, and anterior corpus callosum. correlating with pathology report of biopsy on ___, this likely represents postradiation necrosis rather than recurrent disease. recommend continued interval surveillance.
