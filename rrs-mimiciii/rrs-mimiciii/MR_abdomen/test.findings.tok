there are multiple focal masses within the pancreas. the largest mass measures approximately 22 x 15 mm and is located in the neck/body of the pancreas. multiple smaller lesions are also demonstrated in the body and tail of the pancreas. two other lesions are also visualized in the head of the pancreas. the pancreatic gland is normal in size. there is no evidence of dilatation of the pancreatic ducts. all these masses demonstrate slight hypointensity on t1 weighted images and slight hyperintensity on t2 weighted images compared with the pancreatic parenchyma. after gadolinium administration these masses are hypoenhancing compared with the pancreatic gland. in the portal phase and delayed phase these masses are isointense with the pancreatic parenchyma. there is an innumerable number of lymph nodes in the upper abdomen. some of these lymph nodes appear to form conglomerate/masses particularly in the region of the porta hepatis and peripancreatic region. in the porta hepatis there is a 45 x 23 mm mass. just inferior to the portal vein a 4 x 4cmm mass is also demonstrated. both masses are probable related to conglomerate of lymph nodes. lymph nodes are noted in many other places throughout the upper abdomen including the paraesophageal region and anterior cardiophrenic region. the spleen demonstrates heterogeneous signal intensity on t2 weighted images. after gadolinium administration multiple hypoenhancing ill-defined areas are demonstrated throughout the spleen. the largest of these areas is in the inferior tip and measures approximately 2 cm in diameter. the common bile duct is normal in size although is noted to be stretched by multiple lymph nodes. susceptibility artifact noted in the gallbladder fossa consistent with the presence of surgical material from previous cholecystectomy. both kidneys are slightly prominent in size. although no focal lesions are noted in the kidneys there is poor corticomedullar diferentiation on the haste and post- gadolinium administration vibe sequences. a small amount of free intraperitoneal fluid is demonstrated between the fundus of the stomach and spleen. no focal liver lesions were seen on this study. both adrenal glands are normal. there is extensive lymphadenopathy in the upper abdomen. although the spleen is not enlarged there are multiple focal lesions in the splenic parenchyma. multiple pancreatic masses are also noted. findings are most likely consistent with lymphoma. diffuse infiltration of both kidneys is also possible
sludge was demonstrated within the gallbladder with evidence of some milk of calcium. the gallbladder wall is thickened with some pericholecystic fluid. there is also evidence of ascites in small amount around the liver. the cystic duct hepatic duct and the common bile ducts are not dilated. the pancreas shows normal enhancement with some stranding around it and without any evidence of pancreatic duct dilatation. the spleen is enlarged measuring 14.6 cm. a few small nodes less than 1 cm were demonstrated in the area of the porta hepatis. the adrenals, and the kidneys are unremarkable.
the liver is normal in size with no focal mass; however, there is heterogeneous parenchymal enhancement following administrtion of gadolinium. the intra and extrahepatic bile ducts are of normal caliber. there is a small amount of loculated perihepatic ascites. three tiny 2-3 mm cysts are seen within the right lobe of the liver. the pancreas is normal in morphology and signal with no evidence of pancreatic mass. the pancreatic duct is of normal caliber. the patient is post-splenectomy and right nephrectomy. there is moderate-severe hydronephrosis of the left kidney with an apparent focal narrowing at the upj. there is severe cortical thinning. the left adrenal gland is prominent, though it maintains its normal morphology, with no focal mass. the right adrenal gland is normal. there is a 4.7 cm supra-celiac abdominal aortic aneurysm. in the mid abdominal aorta, there is retroperitoneal enhancing soft tissue around this vessel. it is difficult on these sequences to determine whether the native abdominal aorta is patent due to difficulties in arterial timing. both common iliac arteries are aneurysmal. a patent axillofemoral bypass graft is seen within the subcutaneous soft tissues along the left flank. the intrahepatic veins are engorged. there are bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the right. there is associated consolidation/atelectasis at the lung bases. the visualized portions of the heart show cardiomegaly.
comparison is made to the mri scan of ___/. overall when compared to the prior examination, there has been interval deterioration in the dominant lesion in segment 8. this examination was somewhat limited by breathing artifact making assessment of smaller lesions more difficult. however when allowing for errors of measurement, the remainder of the metastatic lesions in the liver do not show any measurable difference compared to the prior exam. the dominant lesion in segment 8 as measured on the axial t1 in phase sequence today measures 3.5 x 2.5 cm compared to 3.2 x 2.1 cm previously. this same lesion as measured on the coronal haste sequence measures 4.4 cm in craniocaudad length compared to 3.9 cm previously. multiple small and one large cyst in the liver as seen before without any appreciable change. cysts in the kidney including a very large cyst at the lower pole of the right kidney also noted as before. allowing for the limitations of the study because of motion artifact, no new lesions are identified. fatty infiltration of the liver with areas of focal sparing are again noted. there are some small filling defects in the gallbladder, both in the dependent and non dependent positions consistent with polyps and/or small stones.
the head of the pancreas is diffusely enlarged. there is dilatation of the main pancreatic duct at the level of the pancreatic head as well as multiple side branches. post contrast imaging of the pancreas reveal diffuse enhancement of the gland. compared with the previous mri, there is mild decrease in the arterial phase of the entire gland consistent with diffuse edema. a focal area of low signal intensity is demonstrated on the t1 pre and post gadolinium images at the level of the neck of the pancreas. this area measures approximately 1 cm in diameter and demonstrates peripheral rim enhancement after gadolinium administration. this lesion is in the same location where the previous mri demonstrated an intrapancreatic mass. it may be related to residual changes after partial resolution of this mass. the possibility of an intrapancreatic abscess cannot be completely excluded. adjacent to this area, there is a tiny foci of low signal intensity with similar characteristics. although the significance of this area is uncertain, it is very unlikely that this represent pancreatic necrosis. no other focal areas of marked decreased enhancement in the pancreas are noted. there is diffuse peripancreatic edema. large fluid collection is noted extending from the anterior pararenal space, anterior to the body and tail of the pancreas, through the gastrocolic ligament to the level of the posterior aspect of the transverse mesocolon. this collection measures approximately 13 x 5 x 5 cm (craniocaudal x lateral lateral x ap). there is also small amount of free fluid in the interperitoneal cavity. extensive soft tissue edema is also noted in the abdominal wall consistent with third spacing. again are noted multiple lymph nodes around the head of the pancreas, celiac axis, and the porta hepatis, and anterior to the inferior vena cava. there is extensive thickening of the bowel wall, permanently in the duodenum and transverse colon. there is extensive periportal edema. the liver is enlarged. post gadolinium images demonstrate diffuse heterogeneous enhancement of the liver. this finding is nonspecific although it can be seen in acute hepatitis or any other form of acute liver failure. again is noted marked heterogeneity of the spleen with focal lesions. there are bilateral pleural effusions. both kidneys demonstrate poor corticomedullary differentiation. the enhancement of the kidneys post gadolinium is also abnormal with heterogeneity and poor corticomedullary differentiation. the kidneys are normal in size. the portal vein is patent. there is no evidence of thrombosis of the portal vein. splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein are also demonstrated and patent in this mr study. there is no evidence of thrombus in the inferior vena cava. the intra and extrahepatic biliary tree are unremarkable. multiplanar reconstructions were needed to evalaute and confirm the above findings.
there is generalized atrophy of most of the pancreas. at the dorsal aspect of the mid portion of the tail of the pancreas, there is a focal nodular area where the pancreas is somewhat more prominent. this area measures approximately 13 mm in diameter. on all pulse sequences it is isointense to the remainder of the pancreatic parenchyma and its enhancement features are identical to pancreatic parenchyma. no abnormal signal or enhancing features that are typical for islet cell tumors were visualized in this area of anywhere else in the pancreas. no lymphadenopathy or masses. on this study optimized and tailored for evaluation of the pancreas no other abnormality is noted.
there are several stones in the neck of a non-distended gallbladder. no pericholecystic fluid or gallbladder wall thickening. there is no intra or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. no choledocholithiasis. the pancreas is of normal size and signal intensity and enhances uniformly after contrast administration. no peripancreatic fluid collections or fat stranding. normal liver and spleen. there is a moderate sized hiatus hernia. the patient is s/p bilateral nephrectomy.

there is diffuse hypointensity of the liver, spleen, and bone marrow in both t1 and t2 weighted images. this hypointensity is more significant in t1 inphase images compared with t1 out of phase images. this is consistent with susseptability artifact and therefore with involvement of the liver, spleen, and bone marrow should be considered. this is consistent with previous history of multiple blood transfusions. there is an atelectasis and/or consolidation of the left lower lobe and left pleural effusion. an infiltrate is also demonstrated in the right lower lobe. a 15 mm nodule is demonstrated in the right middle lobe. there is a small amount of ascites. both kidneys are small in size and demonstrate poor corticomedullary differentiation consistent with chronic renal failure. the pancreas demonstrates normal signal intensity in all sequences. there is a small hiatal hernia. there is no mr evidence of focal liver lesions or splenic lesions. the renal transplant is only partially visualized in the coronal views of the abdomen. the gallbladder is moderately distended with no signs of cholecystitis. an intra and extrahepatic biliary tree is unremarkable.
there is a large heterogeneous predominantly hemorrhagic fluid collection in the mid abdomen surrounding the pancreas. this measures up to 15 cm in maximum dimension. the pancreas lies in the posterior aspect of this fluid collection. the distal neck, body and most of the pancreatic tail have been replaced by extensive areas of hemorrhage. after the administration of contrast, the pancreatic head and a small portion of the tail show normal enhancement. the hemorrhagic portion of the pancreas does not enhance. there are multiple stones in the gallbladder. the right and left hepatic ducts have a low confluence just outside the pancreas. the entire cystic duct cannot be visualized but it appears to enter the lower portion of the right hepatic duct. there is no biliary dilatation. no intraluminal filling defects identified in the bile ducts. there is a small amount of free fluid around the anterior aspect of the liver. the liver itself enhances heterogeneously after contrast administration but no focal lesions are identified. the portal vein, splenic vein and hepatic veins are all patent. there are small bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis at the right base. normal spleen, kidneys and adrenal glands.

there is a large mass in the left side of the bladder measuring approximately 71 x 30 x 78 mm (craniocaudal x lateral lateral x ap). the lesion involves the whole thickness of the wall of the bladder and is producing retraction of the left lateral wall. these findings are consistent with primary neoplasm of the bladder with invasion of all the layers of the wall. the retraction of the bladder is consistent with desmoplastic reaction and involvement of the muscular layer. images obtained after administration of gadolinium demonstrate brisk arterial enhancement in the inner aspect of the mass and multiple feeding vessels. the rest of the mass enhances heterogeneously during the venous and delayed phase. coronal images demonstrate that the mass is extending inferiorly and is extending into the prostatic urethra. there is a 5 mm lymph node adjacent to the right external iliac vessels. another tiny lymph node is demonstrated adjacent to this area. no other significant enlarged lymph nodes were demonstrated. there are multiple focal lesions in the pelvic bones, consistent with metastasis. the largest lesions are seen in the right iliac ___ (2.5 cm), left iliac ___ (3 cm), left acetabulum (2.5 cm), and left iliac ___ (1.5 cm). other smaller lesions are seen throughout the pelvic bones. a small lesion is also demonstrated in the l4 vertebral body on the right side. there are bilateral renal cysts. there is a 17 mm lesion in the anterior aspect of the left kidney, in its mid portion. this lesion demonstrates high signal intensity on t1w images. delay post contrast images were obtained at this region and there is no clear mr evidence of enhancement of the lesion. subtraction images were not obtained as the pelvis was evaluated during the bolus of gadolinium. however, quantitative analysis of the signal intensity of the lesion before and after administration of gadolinium does not suggest enhancement. this is probably consistent with a hemorrhagic cyst. however if clinically indicated, a dedicated mr of the kidneys can be performed for further evaluation. there is no hydronephrosis. both kidneys are normal in size.
there is a 54 x 51 x 61 mm (ap x lateral-lateral x cc) mass originating in the anterior aspect of the right kidney at the level of the mid portion. this mass demonstrates exophytic growth outside the kidney anteriorly without clear involvement of the renal hilum. the right renal vein is identified and appears to demonstrate normal enhancement after administration of gadolinium. there is no mr evidence of renal vein thrombosis on this study. there is, however, extrinsic compression of the vein by the mass. the described mass demonstrates predominantly cystic components with some septae. these septae demonstrate mild enhancement after administration of gadolinium. due to the imaging characteristics, the most likely diagnosis for this mass is multilocular cystic nephroma. renal cell carcinoma is less likely. there is no mr evidence of enlarged lymph nodes. there is no evidence of involvement of adjacent organs. a fat plane is demonstrated between the mass and inferior aspect of the liver and between the lesion and ivc. there are gallstones. the gallbladder is otherwise unremarkable. the intra and extrahepatic biliary tree is normal. the spleen is in the upper limits of normal with 14 cm in maximal length. the visualized portions of the liver are unremarkable on this mr ___ ___ for evlauation of the kidneys. the left kidney is normal in size and no renal masses are demonstrated. multiplanar reformations were used to fully evaluate the mass characteristics.

dilatation of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary system is noted. the maximal diameter of the extrahepatic bile duct is 1.4 cm in the suprapancreatic portion. there is a tapering of the bile duct through the pancreatic portion. however, no filling defects are seen within the bile duct and no mass is seen within the head of the pancreas to explain the biliary ductal dilatation. the dilatation of the stomach and duodenum as previously seen on the ct scan has resolved in the interval, consistent with ng tube placement. multiple, small round lesions are seen throughout the liver as previously seen on ct scan. as described previously, these are highly suspicious for metastatic foci. lesions are seen throughout the liver with probably the largest lesion within the posterior segment of the right lobe of the liver, measuring 1.3 cm in maximal diameter. there is a mass within the left adrenal gland which shows drop out of signal on the out of phase images consistent with an adrenal adenoma. the right adrenal gland is unremarkable. the gallbladder is not visualized, and likely has been resected.
multiple liver lesions highly suspicious for metastatic disease are again identified. the largest lesion is not significantly changed in size over the interval and on today's exam measures approximately 2.9 x 2.3 cm in axial plane on the t1 in phase images and approximately 4.1 cm in the craniocaudal direction as measured on the coronal haste images. this lesion lies within segment 7 of the liver (not within segment 8 as previously reported). there are no new liver lesions and none of the smaller liver lesions have increased in size over the interval. again seen are multiple liver cysts also without significant interval change. again seen is perfusion abnormality just peripheral to the most dominant liver lesion in segment 7. again identified is fatty infiltration of the liver with areas of focal sparring. small bilateral pleural effusions are seen without significant interval change. again seen are small filling defects within the gallbladder lumen which could represent polyps or stones, not significantly changed over the interval and there is no evidence of cholecystitis. multiple renal cysts are identified in the right kidney the largest one is seen within the lower pole. the spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands appear within normal limits.
there is a large fluid collection in the right hemiabdomen that measures approximately 10 x 3.5 x 4.5 (transverse x ap x craniocaudal) cm. the collection is located anterior to the head of the pancreas and inferior to the inferior border of the right lobe of the liver. the second portion of the duodenum is not currently visualized, and this maybe postoperative in nature. the pancreas is normal in size. the pancreatic duct is normal in the body and tail of the pancreas. at the level of the head of the pancreas, there appears to be communication between the pancreatic duct and the above mentioned fluid collection. findings may represent a fistulous tract. the common bile duct is visualized at the level of the porta hepatis with a normal diameter. at the level of the superior aspect of the head of the pancreas the bile duct presents an abrupt change in caliber and the distal common bile duct is not visualized. the gallbladder is collapsed. there is thickening of the gallbladder wall and pericholecystic fluid. a cholecystostomy catheter is noted in the collapsed lumen of the gallbladder. there is a large amount of intraperitoneal free fluid, predominantly in the left hemiabdomen. the described fluid collection in the right hemiabdomen is noted to extend anteriorly, around the left lobe of the liver, and connect with the fistulous tract in the anterior abdominal wall. evaluation of the duodenal stump is suboptimal as the duodenum is collapsed and not clearly visualized. however, the appearance of the pancreatic duct in the head of the pancreas and its close relationship with the fluid collection, makes the possibility of pancreatic leak most likely. there are two linear defects in the superior aspect of the right lobe of the liver most likely representing changes secondary to the previous interventional procedure (needle track). in the posterior aspect of the right lobe of the liver (segment 8) there is a 20 x 17 mm lesion. this lesion is not clearly visualized on the t2w images. the lesion is better demonstrated in the post gadolinium images. although not completely characterized, the lesion may represent a focal nodular hyperplasia. follow up is recommended. there are simple cysts in the right kidney. a small hypointense lesion is demonstrated in the post contrast images in the anterior aspect of the right kidney. around this lesion there is some heterogeneous enhancement. the lesion demonstrates high signal intensity on t2w images. although this may represent a parapelvic cyst as well, the pattern of enhancement around the lesion is not completely typical. follow up for this lesion is also recommended.

there is a right adrenal mass which measures approximately 1.2 x 0.8 cm. this cannot be characterized due to the poor signal to noise. review of the recent ct of the abdomen dated ___ reveals that this lesion does not ___ attenuation features on ct, but wash-out curves on ct could be used to attempt to establish diagnosis of an adrenal adenoma. the left adrenal is unremarkable. the patient is status post cholecystectomy. the spleen, kidneys, and pancreas as well as liver are unremarkable but this is a markedly limited examination. noted are bilateral pleural effusions and associated dependent atelectasis.
mri of the abdomen: there is a multi-lobulated t1 hypointense lesion primarily present within segment 6 of the right lobe of the liver, but extends into the peripheral aspect of segment 7. precise measurements of this lesion are difficult, secondary to its irregularity and extension into multiple planes, but the lesion measures at least 9.4 cm. when compared with the prior ultrasound, this lesion appears to correspond to an area of hyperechogenicity. there is predominantly peripheral enhancement of this lesion with more focal areas of enhancement at its most peripheral aspect within the right lobe of the liver. no additional intrahepatic lesions are seen. there is no evidence of intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. there are bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. there is atelectasis at the left lower lobe. there are several subcentimeter periportal lymph nodes. adjacent to the head of the pancreas is an approximately 8-mm t2 hyperintense lesion that appears distinct from the pancreatic head, and likely represents a cyst of uncertain significance. there are no suspicious pancreatic masses seen, or evidence of ascites within the abdominal images. the spleen and gallbladder are within normal limits and the kidneys are unremarkable and are without evidence of hydronephrosis. there are no suspicious osseous lesions.
there is new left lower lobe consolidation consistent with pneumonia. since the prior mr, hepatomegaly has developed with the liver measuring up to 25 cm. multiple t1 hypointense lesions with peripheral enhancement and slight t2 hyperintensity consistent with metastases have developed. the largest one is in the posterior right hepatic lobe (segment 6) measuring 11 mm. previous scattered hepatic cysts are re-identified. there has been interval development of multiple wedge shaped abnormalities in the liver which are consistent with profusion abnormalities. the main portal vein is patent however, there has been interval development of multiple periportal lymph nodes measuring up to 2.3 x 1.9 cm which appears to compress the main portal vein. the intrahepatic portal veins are attenuated. on the 2d time of flight, there is evidence of hepatofugal flow within the portal vein. the pancreas is atrophic. the adrenals are normal in appearance. a simple cyst is visualized within the right kidney. the spleen appears bulkier compared to the prior study consistent with mild splenomegaly. the patient is s/p esophagogastrectomy with gastric pull up.

the patient is status post partial colonic resection and the anterocolonic anastomosis is identified in the left lower quadrant. all of the bowel loops display mild distention and there are multiple air fluid levels identified. the rectum is distended. this distention has increased compared with the prior ct examination and its configuration is most suggestive of an ileus. there is some increased soft tissue with enhancement and adjacent fat stranding near the anastomotic site which may represent sequela due to chronic local ischemia in this region. the spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, liver and gallbladder appear within normal limits. again seen are multiple simple cysts in both kidneys. there is patchy signal seen in the bone marrow of the pelvis and sacrum. wound has shown interval healing most prominent along its periphery. several atheromatous plaques are identified in the mid and distal abdominal aorta and several small areas of mild aneurysmal dilatation are identified in the distal aorta. this appearance is not significantly changed over the interval although the prior ct examination was performed without iv contrast.
at the junction of the upper and mid pole of the left kidney and located laterally there is a simple cyst with a maximum dimension of 1.7 cm. just inferior to this simple cyst lies a rounded region with heterogeneous t1 signal, including areas of t1 hyperintensity with maximum dimension of approximately 3.8 x 3.8 cm in the axial plane. within this rounded region of heterogeneous t1 signal there is an oval region of enhancement in a region measuring approximately 1.9 x 1.6 cm. subjacent to this area and abutting the lower pole of the left kidney is a more uniformly t1 hypointense region, which extends along the proximal portion of the iliopsoas muscle. two small subcentimeter foci of t1 hyperintensity, which do not enhance are identified along the proximal portion of the left psoas muscle. although the morphology of the lower pole of the left kidney is slightly distorted, the majority of the left renal parenchyma and the right renal parenchyma displays a normal nephrogram, which is symmetrical in time. there is a 1.6 cm simple cyst in the upper pole of the right kidney. no adrenal masses are identified. the spleen, pancreas, gallbladder and liver appear within normal limits.

no focal lesion seen within the liver or the spleen. the liver and spleen and bone marrow have diffuse low signal on the stir images, which could relate to history of aml. there is no evidence for hepatosplenic candidiasis. the adrenals, right kidney, pancreas, and gallbladder are unremarkable. there is asymmetry of the right psoas muscle and a lesion within the psoas muscle that has low signal on t1 with only rim enhancement. this could represent a hematoma or abscess. the entire lesion is not completely imaged on this study. the lesion measures approximately 5.2 x 4.5 cm. at the midportion of the left kidney, there is a cystic lesion measuring approximately 13 mm. within or adjacent to this cystic lesion there is a 10 mm solid component that appears to enhance on the delayed images. this could represent a lip of normal renal parenchyma, but an early malignancy cannot be excluded. of note, this lesion appears stable compared with the prior ct scan of ___, but follow up is recommended. there are bilateral small pleural effusions and multiple focal areas of consolidation in the visualized lung bases.
there is a moderate stenosis in the proximal left renal artery (approximately 50-70% of the diameter). there is a minimal post stenotic dilatation of the renal artery. the right renal artery is normal. only one renal artery for each kidney was visualized. both kidneys are normal in size. there are bilateral renal cysts. the largest one measuring approximately 11.6 cm and located in the mid portion of the left kidney, in the lateral aspect. there are bilateral pleural effusions. there is extensive edema in the soft tissues of the abdomen. minimal amount of free fluid is demonstrated in the pelvis. there are several masses in the uterus with low signal intensity on t2 weighted images consistent with fibroids. one of them measures approximately 13.6 mm and is in submucosal location. both adrenal glands are normal in size. there is a tiny gallstone in the gallbladder. visualized portions of the liver, spleen, and pancreas are unremarkable in this mri examination tailored for evaluation of the renal arteries. the supra and infrarenal aorta as well as the iliac arteries demonstrate minimal atheromatous disease. there is no mr evidence of aneurysmal dilatation in these vessels. the proximal tibia, mesenteric artery and celiac axis are normal. the ___ is also visualized.
there is a bilobed t1 hypointense, t2 hyperintense, nonenhancing collection extending from the head of the pancreas anteriorly into the peripancreatic tissues. ins this area the pancreatic duct is not clearly seen and disruption is suspected. the intrapancreatic portion of this collection has maximal dimensions of approximately 2 x 1.2 cm and the more inferiorly located extrapancreatic portion of the collection measures approximately 23 x 16 mm in diameter. these two are connected by a thin tract and overall this has a dumbbell-shaped appearance. a round hypointensity in the dependent portion of the gallbladder near the neck measuring 8 mm in diameter is consistent with a stone. there is some fluid around the gallbladder and a small linear collection of fluid tracts along the pancreatic tail. the pancreatic duct is not dilated. the body of the pancreas has slight heterogeneity on t1 and t2w sequences but the tail is relatively normal. the previously described nonenhancing area in the dorsal portion of the head of the pancreas is not as well appreciated today and the fluid collections seen today are more ventral than previously described nonenhancing area. today's fluid collection does seem to be an enlargement of the previously described 7 mm collection in the region of the pancreatic neck. as before, large bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the right than the left. no dilation of the intra or extrahepatic biliary tree. there is some fluid around the dome of the liver and scattered fluid is seen in the left upper quadrant. small nonenhancing areas in the kidneys consistent with small cysts. the liver has a homogeneous appearance and there are no mri findings to suggest hepatic candidiasis. similarly, the spleen has a normal appearance and no findings to suggest splenic candidiasis. the remainder of the structures in the visualized portions of the abdomen are unremarkable.

multiple t1 hypointense, t2 hyperintense and well-defined lesions are seen scattered in both lobes of the liver. all of these are less than 1 cm in diameter, sharply defined and in the right lobe of the liver the lesions measure less than 5 mm in diameter. the left-sided lesions which are somewhat more prominent than seen on the ct but the much smaller right-sided lesions were not seen on ct, probably below the limits of its resolutin. these lesions all have pre and post contrast characteristics of cysts within the liver. no abnormal enhancement is seen to suggest either a vascular lesion such as a hemangioma or an inflammatory process such as an abscess. two lesions were seen in the spleen previously, one anteriorly more superiorly and one more inferiorly posteriorly. the anterior superior lesion is stable and has features of a cyst without any abnormal enhancement. the more inferiorly located lesion has dramatically decreased in size and based on its imaging characteristics and appearance is favored to represent a cyst that may have undergone interval involution. no wedge-shaped lesions are seen in the spleen and the kidneys are within normal limits apart from two very small cortical cysts in the mid and upper pole of the right kidney. no abnormally enlarged lymph nodes, masses or free fluid in the visualized portions of the abdomen. the liver, kidneys, adrenal glands, pancreas, biliary tree and remainder of the major intra and retroperitoneal structures are unremarkable. note is made of susceptibility artifact from the patient's sternotomy wires.
there is a large mass in the left kidney, between the upper pole and mid region, extending from the renal sinus laterally. this mass measures approximately 81 x 71 x 68 mm (cc x ll x ap). again, the mass extends into the renal sinus, and there is mr evidence of thrombus within the proximal aspect of the renal vein. the thrombus extends approximately 2.5 cm medially but is approximately 3 cm lateral to the level of the sma. there is no mr evidence of extension of the thrombus to the level of the sma. the ivc is patent and no filling defects are demonstrated within it. the left gonadal vein is demonstrated on this stidy, and there is no mr evidence of thrombosis in this vessel. only one renal artery is demonstrated for each kidney. there is no mr evidence of venous stenosis in the renal arteries. the supra and infrarenal abdominal aorta is unremarkable. there is no significant atheromatous disease or evidence of aneurysmal dilatation. both iliac arteries are unremarkable. the celiac axis, sma and ___ are normal. the left adrenal gland is normal. there is a 1.5 cm nodule in the right adrenal gland. this nodule demonstrates significant dropoff signal in the t1 out of phase images compared with the t1 in-face images. these findings are consistent with an adrenal adenoma. there are multiple nodules in both lung fields, consistent with metastasis. there is a 6 mm lymph node in the left paraaortic region. there is no fat plane separation between the superior aspect of the described mass in the left kidney and the inferior aspect of the tail of the pancreas. local invasion of the pancreatic gland at this level cannot be excluded. there are degenerative changes in the lumbar spine. no focal bone lesions are noted. there is no mr evidence of focal liver or splenic lesions. the colon is noted to be separated from the mass in this mr examination.
the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and adrenals are normal. the patient is post right nephrectomy. there are no abnormal soft tissue lesions in the nephrectomy bed. there is no adenopathy in the visualized abdomen. the lesion in the lower aspect of the left kidney measures 25 x 25 x 31 mm (progressive growth viewing multiple prior x-sectional studies) and has a thick enhancing nodular rim with a necrotic center. there is a second enhancing 12 mm lesion in the medial aspect of the upper pole of the left kidney. scattered subcentimeter simple renal cysts are also present. there is no hydronephrosis. there is no renal vein invasion. multiplanar reconstructions were used to evaluate location and dtermine enhancement.
there is loss of normal definition around the pancreas which is a finding seen in pancreatitis. no peripancreatic fluid collections are seen. a focal very small fluid collection in the neck of the pancreas measures about 7 mm in diameter and may represent a focal area of disruption of the duct. no mass is seen around this lesion. most of the pancreas enhances normally. because of the lack of breath-hold imaging, resolution is somewhat limited, but there is a suggestion of a subtle, approximately 2-cm area of hypointensity with respect to the surrounding pancreas on a number of sequences in the uncinate process. this may represent a mass lesion in this location. there is no intrahepatic biliary tree dilatation and the common bile duct measures 8 mm in diameter. a cholecystostomy tube is in place. there is perihepatic fluid and bilateral moderate-to-large pleural effusions are present. the splenic artery and vein are intact. allowing for the limitations of the study, no other significant abnormality is noted.
the liver shows atrophy of the left lobe. there is no evidence of intra or extrahepatic bile duct dilatation. the study was performed with a non-breath hold technique and the signal to noise ratio of those sequences is not optimal but there is no evidence of gross enhancing lesions in the liver itself. the portal vein is patent with a hepatopedal flow. there is a small amount of ascites around the liver. the pancreas is unremarkable. the spleen measures 15.5 cm with dilated veins in its hilum. there is evidence of lower esophageal varices with a small hiatal hernia. mr reformats: the above mentioned findings were demonstrated.
the liver is homogeneous without focal masses or abnormalities. there is slight intrahepatic bile duct dilatation. there is no dilatation of the extrahepatic bile ducts. the gallbladder is distended without evidence of gallbladder thickening. hypointense contents were noted on t1w images in the gallbladder and may represent sludge. the pancreatic duct is not dilated. there is no evidence of pancreatic masses. the spleen is unremarkable. the adrenals and kidneys are within normal limits. a few simple cysts are noted in the liver measuring up to 7 mm in diameter. one is at the left lateral lobe and one is in segment 8.
the left adrenal show a lesion that is measuring 11 mm in diameter. it looses signal in the out of phase sequence which is compatible with an adenoma. there is no evidence of a right adrenal lesion. on t2-weighted images, the liver shows vaguely hyperintense regions measuring 12 x 21 mm in the left lateral lobe and a smaller region of 8 x 12 mm in the right lobe in segment 8. this might represent infarcts. no other lesions were noted on the liver. a 'mass' extends through a left diaphragmatic hernia just into the posterior hemithorax is continuous with the liver and has a signal intensity of normal liver parenchyma; the 'mass' is the left lobe of the liver. it may be entering into a posterior diaphragmatic hernia of bochdalek type. there is no dilatation of the intra or extrahepatic bile ducts. the cbd is not dilated. the proximal pancreatic duct was only visualized and its distal part was not seen. the pancreatic bed/anterior pararenal space is largely made up of fluid, pathcy enhancing regions within represent residual pancreatic parenchyma. further follo-wup is needed to see if the fluid collection stabilizes and matures into pseudocyst(s). the spleen is not perfused in its lateral part and shows hyperintensity on t2 sequences. this represents region of infarcted spleen. the splenic vein is attenuated and is barely seen. there is no evidence of arterial abnormalities. the kidneys are well perfused and do not show focal abnormalities.
the infrarenal abdominal aorta is normal in caliber. there is no significant atheromatous disease or aneurysmal dilatation. both common and external iliac arteries are normal in size. no significant stenosis are demonstrated. at the level of the distal right external iliac artery/common femoral artery, the presence of susceptibility artifact in relation with hip prosthesis limits the evaluation of this area. an area of stenosis at this level cannot be excluded. distal to this point, there is the suggestion of a focal area of moderate stenosis in the superficial femoral artery approximately at the level of the femoral neck. however, this area is evaluated with limitation due to the described artifacts. however, the lack of collateral circulation suggests that this is not significant stenosis. correlation with other studies as doppler ultrasound is recommended if clinically indicated. the right superficial femoral artery is unremarkable to the level where it becomes the right popliteal artery, approximately 5.5 cm proximal to the level of the intra-articular space of the right knee. at this level, a focal area of moderate stenosis is demonstrated. the rest of the right popliteal artery is normal. the right anterior tibial artery and right posterior tibial artery are normal proximally. there is a focal area of stenosis in the distal anterior tibial artery. there is significant atheromatous disease in the right peroneal artery which is seen as a very attenuated vessel. in the right foot, good quality dorsalis pedis artery is visualized which becomes very attenuated approximately at the level of the metatarsal bones. there is significant atheromatous disease with multiple areas of stenosis in the distal posterior tibial artery and plantar arch. the left superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery are unremarkable. the left anterior tibial artery is normal. there is marked attenuation of the left posterior tibial artery with multiple areas of significant stenosis. there are mild atheromatous changes in the left peroneal artery although this vessel demonstrates a straight line flow to the level of the left ankle. at the level of the left foot, the dorsalis pedis artery demonstrates a focal area of high grade stenosis in the mid portion. at least 2 other areas of stenosis are demonstrated distally in this vessel. there is reconstitution of the plantar arch via collateral flow from the peroneal artery although this vessel demonstrates significant stenosis at multiple levels within the foot.
the adrenal glands are normal. an approximately 18 x 15 mm rounded hyperintense lesiion at the posterior aspect of the right kidney is seen on the t1w images. on the t2w images this shows slight heterogeneity with focal low signal at its posterior aspect. ultrasound of ___ reports a lesion in the right kidney, which is likely a complec cyst. the mr features suggest that this could be a hemorrhagic cyst, perhaps with some layering material posteriorly. given the specific clinical indication for evaluation of the adrenals, a dedicated renal study was not performed. if clinically indicated, this lesion could be evaluated with dedicated ct or mr of the kidneys or alternatively be followed with ultrasound. a focal low intensity rounded lesion in the left lobe of the liver near the dome of the diaphragm measuring 14 mm in diameter is seen only on the t1w sequences. on this one sequence this suggests that it could be a cyst. again, depending on the clinical circumstances, if definitive characterization is needed this could be evaluated with a dedicated study. increased signal in the right lung is noted. recent radiographs showing air space disease consistent with congestive heart failure +/- pneumonia.
the patient has a long history of constant hiccups. multiple images are degraded by motion artifact. there are small bilateral pleural effusions. there is a tiny cyst in the lower pole of the left kidney, which has high signal on t1-weighted images and is compatible with a proteinaceous or hemorrhagic cyst. there is questionable heterogeneity within the liver; however, the marked motion artifact severely limits assessment, and small masses cannot be excluded. the spleen, adrenals and pancreas are unremarkable. the patient is post-cholecystectomy. the common bile duct is dilated, measuring up to 1.4 cm. at the distal aspect of the common bile duct there is a shelf-like filling defect. there is question of slight enhancing focus within this filling defect on the arterial phase. there is no rounded filling defect suggestive of a stone. there is mild intrahepatic ductal dilatation. no pancreatic ductal dilatation.
there is a 3.3 x 2.9 cm well-circumscribed, enhancing mass in the lower pole of the left kidney. it contains regions of high signal on the non- contrast tl images compatible with hemorrhage, most likely due to recent biopsy. the lesion does not extend into the collecting system. there is no hydronephrosis and the renal vein is patent and clear. there is a single, normal renal artery. the right kidney is normal. no ascites or adenopathy. there is a single, 1 cm hemangioma in the right lobe of the liver. the liver is otherwise clear. there is a single, 0.9 cm nodule on the left adrenal gland which does not have the characteristic appearances of adenoma. the right adrenal gland is normal. normal spleen and pancreas.
the spleen is markedly enlarged with maximum length of 17 cm. there are multiple areas of hypoperfusion within the spleen consistent with infarcts. in the anterior and superior aspect of the spleen, there are several punctate areas of very low signal intensity. these foci of low signal intensity demonstrate susceptibility effect and are suspicious for bubbles of gas. this finding may be normally seen postinfarction. however, infection of the large splenic infarct cannot be ruled out. these findings should be correlated clinically. there is slight hyperintensity of the infarcts on t1- weighted images. these may be related to hemorrhagic contents. there are bilateral pleural effusions. there are multiple gallstones within the gallbladder. there is a gallstone in the gallbladder neck. the gallbladder is moderately distended. there is no gallbladder wall edema or thickening. the liver demonstrates a heterogeneous appearance on postcontrast images. in addition, there is enlargement of the hepatic veins. these findings are most likely consistent with congestive heart failure. there is a small amount of fluid within the peritoneal cavity surrounding the inferior portion of the liver. the portal vein is widely patent and hepatopetal in direction. there are small renal cysts in the left kidney. there are no mr evidence of renal infarcts. no hydronephrosis is noted. the abdominal aorta is unremarkable. the pancreas is normal. there are no enlarged lymph nodes within the abdomen.

there is marked dilatation of the cbd up to 2.5 cm in diameter with abrupt change in its caliber in its distal part that is compatible with stricture. such marked dilatation raises a possibility of a choledochal cyst but in the context of psc, that is less likely. there are a few enhancing nodules in the cbd; one in its lower part on the right and another one higher up. the cbd and the common hepatic duct and the cystic duct are very tortuous with some outpouchings seen between areas of stricture. the outpouchings are clearly seen in the cbd in the distal common hepatic duct and in the cystic duct. the gallbladder is distended without evidence of gallbladder wall thickening. there is also intrahepatic bile duct dilatation of mild-to- moderate degree. there is no evidence of definite masses in the liver or around the bile ducts. the liver is irregular with fluid around it. the spleen is also enlarged measuring 16.9 cm in diameter. these findings are compatible with cirrhosis. there is evidence of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy of small size up to 7 mm. the pancreas has normal enhancement but there is some stranding around it that might be compatible with the patient's history of recent ercp. the pancreatic duct is not dilated. the adrenals and kidneys are normal.
there is evidence of ascites and third spacing with fluid in the subcutaneous tissues. the cecum has a thick wall and is featureless with evidence of hypointense periphery that might be compatible with pneumatosis. fluid is noted in the lumen of the cecum. in the liver there a filling defect (hyponintensity) in the delayed scan that is compatible with left portal vein thrombosis. there is no evidence of other liver masses or anomalies. there is no evidence of intra or extrhepatic bile duct dilatation. the galblladder wall is not thickened and there is no evidence of stones. the spleen is unremarkable. the native kidneys are atrophic. the transplanted kidney measures 13 cm and does not show collections or evidence of hydronephrosis. the transplanted pancreas shows normal enhancement in the left pelvis. there is no evidence of bladder wall thickening. postprocessing, the above-mentioned findings were demonstrated.
the left kidney measures 8.1 cm and the right kidney measures 8.6 cm in diameter. there is no evidence of hydronephrosis in either kidney. there is fullness of the right collecting system without evidence of a constant filling defect. on the haste sequence an area of low intensity was seen in the renal pelvis on the right but this could not be seen in other projections and other sequences. this might be related to flow phenomena and most probably does not represent a stone or constant filling defect. after administration of gadolinium the perfusion of the left kidney is delayed and the nephrogram seen on this kidney is also delayed compared with the right kidney. the aorta at this level is irregular especially on the left side. on this study full characterization of the renal artery could not be performed and the renal arteries could not be evaluated throughout their length. there is no evidence of other renal pathologies on the left side. the liver does not show focal masses or abnormalities. there is no dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts. the cbd measures 1 cm in diameter and the gallbladder was not visualized and was probably resected. the spleen is not enlarged. the adrenals are unremarkable. the pancreas is within normal limits.
there is a large mass arising from the third portion of the duodenum measuring approximately 5.5 x 5.8 x 6.1 cm, with this measurement including the lumen, which is compressed by this mass. the duodenum proximal to the mass is markedly dilated. the mass is centered left of the sma and encases the sma. there is also slight irregularity and scalloping of the left contour of the sma suggesting invasion. the mass is located inferior to the pancreas and abuts a portion of the neck of the pancreas. there is also adjacent left para-aortic adenopathy as seen on the prior ct. smv thrombosis is not appreciated on the current study. note is made of bibasilar atelectasis in the visualized lung bases. there is a 1 cm lesion within segment 4 of the liver which is t1 hypointense and t2 hyperintense, and could represent a cyst, but is too small to definitively characterize, given that the images have motion artifact, and limit assessment of this liver lesion. there is another 1 cm lesion within the right posterior superior segment of the liver, which is nonenhancing, and is compatible with a simple cyst. the spleen, adrenals, kidneys, and gallbladder are unremarkable. multiplanar reconstructed images were essential in delineating the anatomy and pathology and confirm the above stated findings.
there is no intrahepatic ductal dilatation. the cbd appears within normal limits without evidence of dilatation or filling defects. several small gallstones are identified lying dependently within the gallbladder lumen. the gallbladder wall is not thickened and enhances normally. the liver displays a nodular contour and is small. there is a large amount of ascites and there are moderate bilateral pleural effusions. the spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands are within normal limits. a simple cyst is identified in the upper pole of the left kidney and the mid pole of the right kidney, but the kidneys are otherwise unremarkable. multiplanar reconstructions: multiplanar reconstructions were essential in delineating the anatomy and pathology and confirmed the above-stated findings.
there has been a dramatic reduction in the size and number of smoothly marginated peripancreatic fluid collections compared with the recent ct examination. there has been interval decrease in size in the loculated fluid collection with a thin margin of enhancement within the medial portion of the right psoas muscle, this loculated fluid collection now has a maximum dimension of approximately 2.6 x 0.7 cm. there is no significant interval change in the size of left para-aortic lymphadenopathy (1.3 cm minimum axial dimension) as well as subcentimeter retrocaval, celiac axis and portocaval lymph nodes. within the periphery of the right lobe of the liver there is a subtle low intensity area identified on the portal venous phase only which likely represents a perfusion abnormality. the right kidney measures 13.3 cm in length and the left kidney measures 13.1 cm. a simple cyst is identified in the upper pole of the right kidney. the spleen and adrenal glands appear within normal limits. cholelithiasis is identified without evidence of cholecystitis.
two distinct rounded t1 hypointense lesions are identified in the liver, one has a maximum dimension of approximately 1.5 cm and lies within segment 8, and another has a maximum dimension of approximately 1.3 cm and lies within segment 5. the lesion in segment 8 was described on the recent ct exam. both of these lesions display peripheral nodular early enhancement and delayed filling in the post-contrast images, confirming the diagnosis of hemangiomas. both of these lesions display a wedge of increased intensity on early arterial phase images which extends peripherally, and this likely represents associated portal venous shunts. the spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, kidneys and gallbladder appear within normal limits. multiplanar reconstructions: multiplanar reconstructions were essential in delineating the anatomy and pathology and confirm the above-stated findings.
there are bilateral small-to-moderate pleural effusions with associated bilateral lower lobe atelectasis. there is a moderate amount of ascites within the abdomen. multiple cysts are scattered throughout the liver as seen on the prior study. the spleen, adrenals, and kidneys are unremarkable. the gallbladder is distended and contains sludge and a stone. there is again 4 cm aneurysm of the infrarenal abdominal aorta which is unchanged. linear defect in the lumen of the suprarenal abdominal aorta may represent focal area of dissection and is unchanged. a simple cyst is again seen at the upper pole of the right kidney. the pancreas body and tail are unremarkable. there is marked enlargement and peripancreatic inflammation involving the head and neck. the inflammatory mass-like area which includes a portion of the pancreas measures approximately 8.3 x 7.3 cm. this area is markedly heterogeneous with areas that have nonenhancement likely areas of fluid with debris. there is no drainable fluid collection at this time. there is mass effect on the pancreatic neck as well as mass effect on the adjacent stomach and duodenum. the proximal pancreatic duct is unremarkable and is seen up to the neck area where it is likely compressed by the inflammatory mass. similarly the common bile duct which is normal in caliber is visualized up to the pancreatic head/neck area likely compressed by the inflammatory process. the pancreas outside of the inflammatory mass shows no necrosis. multiplanar reconstructions were essential in delineating the anatomy and pathology and confirm the above stated findings.
most of the caudate lobe is occupied by a lesion, that was not seen on prior studies. this lesion has a diameter of 2.9 x 2.3 cm. this lesion enhances after contrast administration. another lesion is seen in the anteromedial border of the right lobe of the liver. this lesion has a diameter of 2.4 cm. the lesion enhances significantly in all phases after administration of contrast. a third lesion is seen in segment 7 with a diameter of 0.8 cm. this lesion has ring enhancement. there is subtle enhancement of the medial border of the right lobe near the surgical incision. there is a tiny retraction of the lateral border in segment 7 with late enhancement of the capsule in this area. this is consistent with postsurgical changes. the spleen, both adrenals and the part of the kidney that is visualized on this exam are unremarkable. multiplanar reconstructions were essential in delineating the anatomy and pathology and confirm the above-stated findings.
there is marked intra and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. there is also cystic dilatation of the pancreatic main duct and side branches. the gallbladder is contracted, containing multiple gallstones. the cystic duct has a low insertion site and is also dilated. the dilated common bile duct quickly tapers in the region of the pancreatic head. a 2-cm ill-defined soft tissue density is seen in the pancreatic head region, with mass effect on the adjacent common bile duct. however, it is difficult to further characterize this soft tissue density because the patient could not hold his breath, and the images are degraded by respiratory motion. multiple cysts are also demonstrated in the liver and both kidneys. the adrenal gland appears unremarkable. there is no definite evidence of significant abdominal lymphadenopathy. both kidneys are small in size with cortical atrophy. visible osseous structures appear grossly unremarkable. multiplanar reconstruction images were essential in delineating the anatomy and pathology and confirm the above findings.
there are two renal arteries on the right including a larger main renal artery and more superiorly located smaller accessory renal artery. both of these renal arteries appear within normal limits without evidence of stenosis. there is possibly a third right renal artery which alternatively could represent an adrenal artery, but there is no evidence of stenosis in this artery. there are two left renal arteries, a larger main renal artery and a more inferiorly located smaller accessory renal artery. both of these left renal arteries are within normal limits and without stenoses. there is a pericapsular hematoma adjacent to the inferior pole of the right kidney with maximum dimensions of approximately 6.9 x 2.6 cm which extends along the right psoas muscle. there is a much smaller subcapsular hematoma adjacent to the inferior pole of the right kidney with maximum dimensions of approximately 1.5 x 0.7 cm in the transverse and craniocaudal dimensions respectively. this subcapsular hematoma does not appear to produce significant mass effect upon the parenchyma of the inferior pole of the right kidney. the maximum linear dimensions of the kidneys is 10.0 cm on the right and 12.2 cm on the left. there is a 5 mm simple cyst identified in the upper pole of the right kidney. the adrenal glands are not well seen but no adrenal masses are identified. the spleen, pancreas, liver, gallbladder and common bile duct appear within normal limits. multiplanar reconstructions: these were essential in delineating the anatomy and pathology as described above.
abdomen: the patient is s/p partial hepatectomy and cholecystectomy. a well circumscribed 0.6 cm diameter, nonenhancing, fluid signal lesion is present within segment 2 of the liver. two separate fluid collections above the dome of the liver are unchanged as is a fluid collection inferior to the liver, just right lateral to the pancreatic head, which measures 5.9 x 5.6 x 4.1 cm. no new focal liver lesions are identified and there is no evidence of intra or extrahepatic biliary duct dilatation. the common duct measures approximately 3-4 mm in diameter. the pancreas is normal in appearance, specifically there is no evidence of a mass or other obstructing lesion within the pancreatic head. a well circumscribed nonenhancing lesion is present within the right upper pole kidney which measures 1.8 cm in diameter and demonstrates fluid signal, consistent with a cyst. a similar appearing but smaller lesion is present within the left interpolar kidney. otherwise, the kidneys are unremarkable. the adrenal glands, spleen, stomach and visualized bowel are also unremarkable. incidental imaging of the inferior chest demonstrates a large right pleural fluid collection with compressive atelectatic change of the right lower lobe. a small left pleural fluid collection is present with subsegmental atelectatic change in the left base.
a new, ill-defined, predominantly cystic mass in the body of the pancreas measures approximately 2.8 x 5.5 x 2.3 cm. the margins of this lesion are irregular with foci of nodular thickening, however, no contrast enhancement is identified. much of the remainder of the body of the pancreas also fails to demonstrate contrast enhancement, as demonstrated on the prior mri. a small, 3-mm-diameter, non-enhancing, fluid-signal, well-circumscribed lesion is present within the left lobe of liver. otherwise, the liver is unremarkable. the gallbladder is normal in appearance, however, there is mild intrahepatic ductal dilatation. the common bile duct is dilated at 10 mm in diameter. the distal aspect of the common duct is not visualized, however, no distinct mass or filling defect is identified in this region. the pancreatic duct is unremarkable. a well-circumscribed fluid-signal non-enhancing lesion in the right upper pole of kidney is again identified, measuring 5.9 x 7.9 cm, not significantly changed compared with the prior exam. right hydronephrosis is again identified and not changed in degree compared with the most recent ct exam. the previously-noted upj stone is not identified on today's mri. layering debris is present within the right renal collecting system. moderate right- sided perinephric inflammatory stranding is also present. the left kidney is unremarkable. an ill-defined, 2-cm-diameter lesion within the anterior aspect of the spleen is unchanged compared with the prior exam. otherwise, the spleen is unremarkable. the adrenal glands, stomach and visualized bowel are also unremarkable. two hepatoduodenal ligament lymph nodes measuring 1.4 and 1.0 cm in diameter are not significantly changed compared with the prior exam. however, multiple periaortic lymph nodes are present on today's examination, the largest of which measures 1.2 cm in short axis, which were not seen on the prior examinations. no significant peripancreatic inflammatory change is identified. incidental imaging of the inferior chest demonstrates atelectatic change in the right lung base. a small right pleural fluid collection is present.
the patient has a known large pelvic mass which has been biopsied recently. a large pelvic mass is seen on the scout images. this study was directed toward evaluation of the liver lesion. there are small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis as seen on the chest ct. there is a 6 mm simple cyst at the anterior left lobe of the liver also seen on the chest ct. there is a 1.9 x 1.6 cm cyst with septation in the right posterior-superior segment. there are additional tiny foci which have low signal on t1-weighted images and high signal on t2- weighted images within the right lobe of the liver which are too small to characterize and likely tiny cysts or hemangiomas. no enhancing liver mass is identified. multiple low attenuation splenic lesions were identified on the prior chest ct. these are poorly visualized on this mri. the adrenals, pancreas, and gallbladder are unremarkable. there are multiple simple cysts in both kidneys, right side greater than left. the largest cyst is in the right kidney and measures 4.7 x 3.4 cm. in addition there are bilateral small renal cysts that have hyperintensity on t1- weighted images before contrast administration, most likely representing hemorrhagic cysts. there are multiple parapelvic hemorrhagic cysts on the left side. there is mild bilateral hydronephrosis which may be related to the large pelvic mass. the common bile duct measures 7 mm in maximum diameter. the pancreatic duct is normal. there is mild prominence of the central intrahepatic biliary ducts. multiplanar reconstructed images were essential in delineating the anatomy and pathology and confirm the above-stated findings.

there is evidence of bilateral ureteral diversion, with ileal conduit. the left renal pelvis is dilated, with blunting of the calices. the left ureter is is prominent without focal stenosis. there is enhancement of the ureteral wall and renal pelvis, without focal mass identified. this finding is likely due to infection/inflammation. there is less distinct left corticomedullary differentiation. the left renal parenchymal enhancement is slightly delayed, as well. however, there is no focal solid enhancing mass seen in the left kidney. the right kidney has good corticomedullary differentiation. there is slight prominence of the right ureter, which is probably related to the ureteral diversion. scattered 1-cm-sized or sub-cm cysts are seen in bilateral kidneys. no calculi are seen in the urinary collecting system. the ileal conduit is patent and not dilated. there is drop of signal of the liver on the opposed-phase images, compatible with fatty infiltration. no focal hepatic masses are seen on these available images. there is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. the proximal common bile duct is prominent, measuring 1 cm in diameter. however, it tapers distally. the pancreas, adrenal glands, and the spleen are unremarkable. the gallbladder is present. there is no focal collection seen in the abdomen or pelvis. there is no significant lymphadenopathy.
the patient's abdominal aortic graft is identified. there is high signal intensity surrounding the graft on both t1- and t2-weighted images which could represent residual hematoma/thrombus, however, this could alternatively represent perigraft infection and the two possibilities cannot be distinguished by mri criteria. there is no appreciable enhancement of this tissue surrounding the graft. just to the left of the aorta in the anterior pararenal space at the level of the lower pole of the left kidney is a 3.5 x 7.7 x 2.4 cm collection which is essentially high in t2 signal and low in t1 signal with a surrounding rim which is high is signal on t1-weighted images and low in signal on t2-weighted images. no evidence of blooming artifact to suggest air. no appreciable enhancement in the wall of this collection. overall, it could represent a residual hematoma, however, infection again cannot be excluded in this collection. this collection corresponds to the collection described on the previous ct scan. also noted within the abdomen is a small-to-moderate amount of ascites. multiple cysts are seen within the liver. the findings were discussed with the clinical service on ___ at approximately 8:00pm. a possible additional study to distinguish between hematoma and infection would be an indium-labeled white blood cell scan in the nuclear medicine department.

comparison is made to ct dated ___. there is a 4.4 x 4.2 x 4.1 cm lesion at the upper pole lateral aspect of the right kidney. the lesion shows hypointensity on haste sequence, hyperintensity on t1w sequence. there is no definite nodular enhancement in the lesion. it probably represents a hemorrhagic cyst or cyst with proteinaceous contents. there is a hypointense rim surrounding this cyst, which correlates with calcification seen on ct scan. there are also multiple bilateral renal cysts. the largest cyst in the right kidney is at the lower pole which measures 5 cm. the largest cyst in the left kidney is at the peripelvic region, which measures 4 cm. bilateral adrenal glands, pancreas, and the spleen are unremarkable. there is abnormal signal in the gallbladder fossa, which shows enhancement, and measures 2.6 x 4.6 cm. the current study is tailored to evaluate the kidneys, and therefore this area is suboptimally evaluated. dedicated cross sectional imaging can be performed. it is uncertain whether this represents post operative change. there is also focal 2.4 cm area of enhancement at the posterior lower segment 6 of the liver, which is wedge-shaped, probably represents perfusion abnormalities. there is no intrahepatic or extrahepatic or biliary ductal dilatation identified. however, the extrahepatic biliary duct is only segmentally visualized. there is no significant lymphadenopathy or ascites.
there is moderate intrahepatic biliary dilatation. the common hepatic duct is not well visualized, consistent with the appearance of a stricture. the patient is noted to be status post cholecystectomy and choledochojejunostomy. no filling defects are seen within the intrahepatic biliary tree. examination of the remainder of the abdomen is markedly limited given the lack of contrast. incidental note is made of a focal scar in the pole of the left kidney with a dilated upper pole calix in the region of parenchymal atrophy. there is right sided hydronephrosis and hydroureter. the distal ureter is not visualized. clinical correlation is recommended. multiple small cystic lesions are seen within the pancreatic body and tail. these findings are nonspecific and may be related to prior episodes of pancreatitis. clinical correlation is recommended. alternatively this may represent ipmt (intraductal papillary mucinous tumor). ercp may be helpful for further evaluation. incidental note is made of severe s-shaped scoliosis. percutaneous jejunostomy tube is noted with balloon inflated in the fundus of the stomach. multiplanar reformatted images generated on a 3d work station were essential for the interpretation of this case.
the right gonadal vein is markedly distended by thrombus. this thrombus extends into the inferior vena cava and fills the suprarenal ivc, intrahepatic ivc, and extends into the right atrium. the upper limit of the thrombus was not visualized on this examination as it extends above the abdomen. correlation with recent ct scan confirms that the thrombus does extend into the right atrium. gadolinium enhanced images demonstrate marked contrast enhancement of the thrombus in the arterial phase, prior to the arrival of venous return into the inferior vena cava. this confirms the presence of tumor thrombus. parasitized arterial feeders are noted arising from the aorta, going directly into the thrombus within the inferior vena cava as well, further confirming the presence of tumor thrombus. the renal veins are patent bilaterally, as is the infrarenal inferior vena cava, which is free of thrombus. the left gonadal vein is dilated, likely secondary to back pressure. tof images confirm the presence of antegrade flow in the left gonadal vein without thrombus. arterial phase images demonstrate a normal appearance of the abdominal aorta, iliac arteries, and major aortic branches. of note, there are markedly hypertrophied arteries feeding the massive tumor in the pelvis, which appear to represent hypertrophied uterine areteries, right greater than left. the mass was not specifically evaluated on this mri, tailored to the evaluation of the vasculature. correlation of the imaging findings with prior ct and mri scans was performed. the imaging findings are most consistent with a massive uterine liomyosarcoma with tumor thrombus extending up the right gonadal vein into the inferior vena cava and right atrium. this was discussed with the house staff. maximum intensity projection and multiplanar reformatted images generated on the 3d workstation were essential to the interpretation of this case.
the celiac artery is slightly narrowed approximately 2 cm from its origin, without post stenotic dilatation or collateral formation. the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries are patent and of normal caliber. the abdominal aorta appears normal throughout. there is no retroperitoneal lymph node enlargement. cholecystectomy clips are noted. there is slight prominence of the common bile duct, within normal limits post cholecystectomy. the spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands and kidneys are normal. subtraction confirm the findings described above.
there is bilateral atrophy of the kidneys, each kidney measuring 7 cm in length. bilaterally, the cortex is relatively thin and there is markedly delayed excretion of contrast material into the collecting system. there is no hydronephrosis. the right kidney demonstrates several cysts and neither kidney shows enhancing neoplasm. simple hepatic cysts were demonstrated. the adrenal glands show bilateral sharply marginated lesions which drop in signal intensity on the opposed-phase as compared to in-phase image, consistent with bilateral adenomas. however, the right adrenal lesion shows substantial enhancement which is somewhat atypical for adenomas. other considerations could be a hemangioma of the adrenal gland or (less likely) pheochromocytoma. relevant chemistry data would assist with the latter. the spleen, pancreas and biliary tract appeared normal. the abdominal aorta shows atherosclerotic changes without evidence of aneurysmal dilatation. the right kidney is supplied by two ___ arteries, both of which show a relatively attenuated appearance diffusely and without focal stenosis. the left kidney shows a single ___ artery which is widely patent. the origins of the celiac axis and sma are widely patent. incidental note is made of bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, and evidence of third spacing with ascites and subcutaneous edema.
within the left lobe of the liver, there are two lesions which are hypointense on t1-weighted images, moderately hyperintense and poorly defined on t2-weighted images, and have rim enhancement after gadolinium administration. these were present on the ct of ___, where they appeared as ill-defined areas of low density. other smaller areas of low density on the previous ct show no corresponding lesions on this study. a small area of enhancement in the periphery of segment 7 is likely due to a small shunt, unlikely to be of clinical significance. at the inferior tip of the spleen, there is a 1.3 cm cyst with debris, likely representing some hemorrhage. there is no abnormal enhancement. the gallbladder is sludge-filled. no stones are identified. there is no biliary ductal dilatation. the pancreas and adrenal glands are normal. the kidneys contain multiple cysts. there is a 1.3 cm cyst in the medial right kidney, at the junction of the upper and middle thirds which has complex internal septations. no enlarged lymph nodes are seen. there are no abdominal fluid collections. the imaged portion of the bowel is unremarkable. the colon is not imaged in its entirety. subtraction images show ring enhancement around the two lesions in the left hepatic lobe as well as internal enhancement within the complex cyst in the right kidney.
there is a small right pleural effusion. a moderate amount of ascites is present. a small amount of loculated ascites is seen in the peripancreatic region at the entrance to the lesser sac. the portal vein is occluded extrahepatically and appears to be extremely attenuated intrahepatically. the splenic vein is patent. multiple large varices are seen, including gastroesophageal and retroperitoneal. the spleen is at the upper limits of normal in size measuring approximately 12 cm in length. the patient is noted to be status post choledochojejunostomy, with a loop of jejunum identified in the hilum of the liver. segmental biliary dilatation is present in segments 4 and 8 of the liver. an ill-defined area of increased enhancement is seen surrounding these dilated ducts. though not specific, these findings are concerning for intrahepatic extension of cholangiocarcinoma. the pancreas appears within normal limits. the kidneys and adrenal glands appear within normal limits. multiplanar reformatted images generated on a 3d workstation were essential to the interpretation of this case.
the gallbladder is not dilated, though it contains multiple filling defects consistent with stones. there is mild wall thickening of the gallbladder measuring a maximum of 3.7 mm in diameter. there is a small amount of pericholecystic inflammatory change. given the recent percutaneous drainage of the gallbladder, lack of distention is of uncertain significance. the overall appearance may be consistent with cholecystitis. clinical correlation is recommended. a small nonobstructing filling defect is seen in the gallbladder neck, consistent with a calculus. there is no evidence of choledocholithiasis. there is no intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. there is mild focal dilatation of the distal common duct approximately 1 cm superior to the ampulla. this focal dilatation measures approximately 8 mm in diameter where as the more proximal common duct measures approximately 5 mm in diameter. this is of unclear clinical significance, though likely represents the sequelae of prior passed stones. the pancreatic duct appears within normal limits. the pancreatic parenchyma is normal, without evidence of pancreatic mass. the liver appears within normal limits without evidence of focal mass. the spleen appears within normal limits. the kidneys and adrenal glands appear normal. there is no evidence of significant adenopathy. the visualized bone marrow demonstrates normal signal intensity on all pulse sequences. multiplanar reformatted images generated on a 3d work station were essential to the interpretation of this case.

the gallbladder is not well defined and mostly replaced by soft tissue mass. adjacent to the gallbladder, in segment v, there is a large, hypointense, irregular mass measuring at least 4 x 2.5 cm. the central portion of this lesion does not enhance and probably reflects necrosis. this mass extends beyond the liver to obliterate the fat plane between the pylorus and duodenum. in the periphery of segment ___, ___ ill- defined 1.3 cm t2 hyperintense and hypervascular lesion is present. biliary ducts distal to this lesion are dilated. there is also central biliary ductal dilatation involving both the left and right lobes. a short 1.5-cm segment of focal stenosis is seen within the proximal common bile duct. the wall of this stenotic segment demonstrates mild thickening and enhancement. this focal stenosis appears to be caused by extrinsic compression from the large segment v hepatic mass. a hypointense filling defect is identified within the distal common bile duct. the pancreas, spleen and adrenal glands are normal in appearance. visualized portions of the kidneys are unremarkable. a small periportal lymph node is noted.
multiple small hepatic nodules with central hypointensity on pre- contrast t1-weighted images with circumferential nodular enhancement have increased in size and number since the previous examination, consistent metastases. the sizes now range from 8 mm to 14 mm in diameter. new lesions are now identified in segments 3 and 7. the large resection cavity in segment 7 is unchanged in configuration. the nodular contour around the inferior margin has slightly decreased, representing postsurgical changes. the resection cavity in segment 3 is unremarkable. no periportal or mesenteric lymph nodes identified. the adrenal glands, pancreas, spleen and visualized portions of the kidneys are unremarkable. the infrarenal abdominal aorta is ectatic with extensive mural thrombus.
innumerable, well-circumscribed hepatic lesions are seen which are predominantly hypointense on t2 weighted images and hyperintense on t2 weighted images, and demonstrate significant contrast enhancement. these findings are consistent with known metastatic disease. in comparison to prior mri scans, there are more lesions on the current examination, and the previously seen lesions are significantly larger in size. specifically, the largest lesion previously seen in segment 5 had significantly decreased in size between the prior two examinations going from approximately 1.7 x 1.4 mm in maximum transverse diameter down to 1.2 x 0.9 cm in diameter. it has now increased to approximately 1.8 x 1.5 cm. another lesion in segment 4 has grown from approximately 8 mm x 7 mm on ___ to a current size of approximately 13 mm x 13 mm. there is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. the portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. the hepatic veins are patent. the gallbladder is within normal limits in size without evidence of filling defects. the spleen and pancreas appear within normal limits. the kidneys demonstrate unusually high t1 weighted signal intensity in the renal pyramids diffusely bilaterally. this is non-specific in appearance, however likely relates to history of renal failure. no enhancing renal masses are seen. the adrenal glands appear within normal limits. a lymph node measuring 1.8 x 1.5 cm in transverse diameter is seen in the aortocaval space. no other enlarged lymph nodes are seen. the visualized bone marrow demonstrates normal signal intensity on all pulse sequences.
short 5 mm segment of the suprarenal ivc is severly stenosed. a long segment of the ivc inferior to the stenosis is distended and occluded by nonenhancing thrombus, which extends into both common iliac veins. thrombus terminates at the bifurcation of the common iliac vein. both internal and external iliac veins have reconstituted and are opacified by contrast. the wall of the thrombus containing ivc and common iliac veins demonstrate linear enhancement consistent with acute or supraacute thrombus. the left lumbar vein at the level of l5 is also thrombosed. the inferior mesenteric vein is enlarged from collateral vasculature. in the region of the stenosis, there is extensive collateral vasculature, involving the lumbar veins. the intrahepatic ivc is attenuated. a connection between the inferior vena cava to the azygous vein cannot be made. the superior mesenteric vein is patent without thrombus. both kidneys are normal in size. no lymphadenopathy is identified. there is no free fluid.
there are numerous pulmonary nodules and bilateral small pleural effusion. the adrenal glands are normal. there is persistent marked hydroureter and hydronephrosis on the right. no new lesions are seen in the imaged portions of the liver, spleen, pancreas, or left kidney. subtraction images show homogeneous enhancement of both adrenal glands, without masses.

the abdominal aorta is of normal caliber. the celiac artery has an unremarkable appearance. the superior mesenteric artery is of normal caliber, although there is a mild waist near its origin. this is of doubtful clinical significance and this appearance is likely related to the presence of the median arcuate ligament as well as a somewhat high-riding left renal vein. the more distal sma is unremarkable. the ___ appears to be of normal caliber. both renal arteries are patent, without evidence for stenosis. there is a subtle area of increased signal intensity on the arterial-phase images within segment 8 of the liver. this corresponds to a similar finding on the prior study from ___, and this likely relates to focal nodular hyperplasia. the liver is otherwise unremarkable. there is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation. the spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are unremarkable. there is a 5 mm focus of increased signal intensity on t1-weighted images, which does not demonstrate enhancement on the postcontrast images. this likely represents a hemorrhagic cyst. other tiny simple- appearing cysts are identified in the left kidney. there is no adenopathy. incidental note is made of a probable hemangioma within the l3 vertebral body.
there is diffuse drop in the signal intensity of the liver, spleen, and bone marrow on the out-of-phase images, consistent with hemosiderosis. this is not significantly changed from the prior mri. there is a focal defect within the inferior, posterior right hepatic lobe, which is of low signal intensity on t1- and t2-weighted images. this likely relates to a scar, and this is somewhat less conspicuous than on the prior mri. no new focal hepatic lesions are identified. there is no evidence for hepatic mass or candidiasis. there is no intra- or extrahepatic ductal dilatation. the gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are unremarkable. there is a small simple-appearing cyst within the upper pole of the right kidney. there is no significant lymphadenopathy.
post resection sites in segments 3 and 7 are unchanged with no abnormal enhancement. within the soft tissues anterior to the resection site within segment 3 there is slight enhancement, but this is decreased over time and probably related to surgical history. multiple previously visualized metastases, predominantly within the dome of the liver are much less conspicuous on today's study with slight residua and residual enhancement. no new lesion is detected. the 2.9 x 2.5 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm is unchanged. both adrenal glands, and visualized portions of the pancreas, spleen, and kidneys are unremarkable.
the patient is status post right nephrectomy. surgical clips are visualized in the renal bed. a heterogeneous vividly enhancing mass is visualized in the anatomic location of the right adrenal gland. the right adrenal gland is not visualized. the mass measures 3.4 x 4.6 x 4.3 cm. it appeares heterogenous, markedly enhancing and has two very small cystic components within it. the mass is in close contact with the ivc, compressing it anteriorly. the left adrenal gland appears normal. the left kidney is normal with no hydronephrosis measuring 12 cm in its longest dimension. a small simple cyst is visualized in the lower pole. no other mass or pathologic enhancement is seen. no other lymph node enlargement is visualized. the spleen, liver, pancreas, cbd and gallbladder are within normal limits.

the patient motion limits evaluation of the hepatic vasculature. the common hepatic artery appears to arise from the celiac axis. there is possibly a common trunk for the middle and right hepatic veins, but this may represent artifact due to motion. the portal vein is small but patent and there is a suggestion of retrograde (hepatofugal) flow. there is moderate ascites. there are bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis at the lung bases. on the coronal images, there is a suggestion of a perihilar peribronchial cuffing which may represent pulmonary edema. the spleen is enlarged, measuring 14 cm. the visualized portions of the pancreas, both adrenal glands and both kidneys are normal.
there are single renal arteries and veins bilaterally. there is a moderate ostial stenosis of the right renal artery. the left renal artery has an unremarkable appearance. several small, subcentimeter simple cysts are identified within both kidneys. the visualized portion of the celiac artery and superior mesenteric artery are unremarkable. there is aneurysmal dilatation of the thoraco-abdominal aorta, measuring up to 4.4 cm. multiple gallstones are present. the gallbladder is otherwise unremarkable. the liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are within normal limits. there is a focal area of increased signal intensity on t2 weighted images arising within the body of the pancreas. the pancreatic duct is of normal caliber. there is no intra or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. there is no significant lymph adenopathy. no bone marrow signal abnormalities are identified. there is diffuse edema within the subcutaneous tissues of the patient. there are also bilateral pleural effusions. mr reformations: reformatted images were crucial in delineating the above findings.

the abdominal aorta is normal in caliber, without evidence of aneurysmal dilatation. there is mild plaque within the abdominal aorta. there is minimal irregularity of the proximal right renal artery, with no significant stenosis. left renal artery is widely patent. the common iliac arteries are tortuous, though non- aneurysmal. there is minimal narrowing of the origin of the right internal iliac artery. both internal iliac arteries, however, are patent. the iliac arteries are widely patent. on the right, there is demonstration of early venous flow in the right common femoral vein, external iliac vein, common iliac vein and inferior vena cava. no flow is seen below the level of the common femoral vein on the arterial phase. the findings are consistent with an arterial venous fistula at the level of the right common femoral vein. note is made of a linear filling defect within the right common femoral vein measuring approximately 5 cm in length x 5 mm transverse. as the patient's right groin central line had been removed prior to the study (as confirmed by the patient's house staff), this apparent filling defect is consistent with a nonocclusive thrombus. due to early venous return of arterial contrast material secondary to the av fistula, flow in the right leg is slightly diminished compared with the left. there is mild multifocal irregularity within the superficial femoral artery on the right, with mild focal narrowing in the adductor canal. the popliteal artery is patent. the anterior tibial artery is visualized at its origin, but occludes shortly beyond its origin. there is stenosis of multiple areas within the tibioperoneal trunk, particularly at its origin. there is multifocal stenosis of the proximal posterior tibial artery, though posterior tibial artery flow is seen to the level of the plantar foot. the peroneal artery is occluded at its origin, but reconstitutes approximately 3 cm distal to its origin via collaterals. the peroneal artery terminates at the level of the ankle. no reconstitution of the anterior tibial or dorsalis pedis artery is identified. on the left, there is minimal multifocal irregularity of the superficial femoral artery, without significant stenosis.
the abdominal aorta is normal in caliber with minimal atherosclerotic disease. an ulcerated plaque is visualized within the abdominal aorta, at the level of the celiac artery. there is no evidence for an abdominal aortic aneurysm. the origin of the celiac artery, sma and ___ are widely patent without evidence of stenosis. there is a mild-to- moderate stenosis of the mid sma with posterior atheromatous plaque, producing an approximately 40% stenosis. there is stenosis at the right renal artery. however, it is difficult to characterize on the acquire sequences. the left renal artery is normal in caliber. the liver, spleen and bone marrow are diffusely low in signal on t1- and t2- weighted sequences consistent with hemosiderosis. the pancreas is normal in signal. there is moderate peripancreatic and perisplenic ascites. gallbladder is unremarkable without gallstones. common bile duct is normal in caliber. visualized small and large bowel are normal caliber without evidence for wall edema. both kidneys demonstrate cortical thinning consistent with chronic renal disease. the adrenal glands are unremarkable. there are bilateral pleural effusions. multiplanar reconstruction images confirm the above vascular anatomy.
the liver is normal in size and homogeneous in signal intensity. there is some mild decrease in signal on the out of phase t1 weighted images in keeping with mild fatty infiltration as described on the patient's prior ct scan. there is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. multiplanar mrcp images demonstrate conventional biliary anatomy, no left-right crossover. post contrast enhanced images confirm normal conventional hepatic arterial and portal anatomy, as well as the hepatic vein anatomy described on the recent ct scan. the gallbladder is within normal limits with no intraluminal stones or wall thickening. the extrahepatic common bile duct measures just 2-3 mm in size. the pancreatic duct is normal in appearance. no intraluminal filling defects are identified within the biliary system. the pancreatic gland enhances homogeneously. the adrenal glands and spleen are within normal limits. the kidneys are symmetric in size and demonstrate normal corticomedullary differentiation bilaterally. no enhancing renal masses are seen and there is no hydronephrosis. the visualized loops of large and small bowel in the abdomen are within normal limits in wall thickness and caliber. no enlarged lymph nodes are seen in the mesentery or retroperitoneum. there is no ascites in the abdomen.
the pancreatic duct is dilated especially within the body. the filling defect seen on cat scan shows no evidence of enhancement and is markedly hypointense on the t2 weighted sequence consistent with a large stone. smaller pancreatic duct stones are seen as well. gallstones and a stone in the neck of the gallbladder were noted. the gallbladder wall appears thickened and there is gallbladder wall edema. this is associated with hyperperfusion in the adjacent hepatic parenchyma during the arterial phase, a sign which is quite specific for acute cholecystitis. no choledocholithiasis. cbd caliber is within normal limits. mild stranding along the left anterior pararenal space suggest findings of pancreatitis. the pancreas enhances and there is no evidence of necrosis. there are no fluid collection in the peripancreatic bed. a small amount of ascites is noted adjacent to the liver. the liver, spleen, adrenals, and kidneys are within normal limits.
mr abdomen with contrast: there is fusion of the lower poles of both kidneys just below the level of the inferior mesenteric artery and anterior to the aorta, representing a horseshoe kidney. the horseshoe kidney is supplied by three renal arteries. the origin of the left renal artery in the aorta is in its normal location. the right renal artery originates inferiorly off the aorta. a third branch originates inferiorly in the midline, proximal to the aortic bifurcation. this artery extends superiorly and bifurcates giving one branch for the lower pole of each kidney at both sides of the renal istmus. spatial resolution is limited secondary to limited patient's breath-hold capacity. no gross luminal irregularity or aneurysmal formation or stenosis is identified. there are multiple small wedge-shaped cortical perfusion defects, representing multiple infarcts. no enhancing renal mass is identified. in and out of phase images demonstrate no fat- containing mass. a hemorrhagic cyst is seen in the upper pole of the left kidney, measuring 1.9 cm. adjacent to and surrounding the right kidney is a heterogeneous, intermediate and high signal mass extending inferiorly which represents a large hematoma. the region of involvement of hemorrhage is essentially unchanged from the recent ct examination. there is compression of the adjacent inferior vena cava, but the inferior vena cava is patent. compression of the renal vein is also noted, however the renal vein also remains patent. no enlarged regional lymph nodes are identified. the visualized bowel is normal in caliber and wall thickness. heterogeneous signal arising from the bone marrow of the vertebral bodies is likely related to degenerative changes and vacuum phenomenon. the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are unremarkable. review of reconstructed images was essential in confirming the above findings.
the liver demonstrates signal intensity and morphology characteristics consistent with known history of cirrhosis. metallic artifact is seen bridging the right portal vein and right hepatic vein consistent with an indwelling tips shunt. contrast is seen within the lumen of the shunt, indicating patency, however evaluation of the shunt is limited by metallic artifact. there is no intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. a large amount of ascites is seen in the upper abdomen. splenomegaly is present with the spleen measuring 16 cm in length. the right renal pelvis is dilated as is the proximal right ureter. the distal ureter is not evaluated as this examination was tailored to the abdomen. further evaluation with ultrasound is recommended if clinically indicated. the pancreas appears within normal limits.
comparison is made to prior mri examination dated ___. once again, multiple tiny (less than 1 cm) well-circumscribed round foci of increased signal is seen on t2w images in both the right and left lobes of the liver. there is no clear evidence of contrast enhancement of these lesions. the lesions are unchanged in number, size, and signal intensity when compared to the prior mri dated ___. the findings are nonspecific, and the differential diagnosis includes multiple tiny cysts, and biliary hamartomas. in this clinical setting, hepatic candidiasis is a possibility, though the findings are not diagnostic of this entity. no lesions are seen in the spleen. the pancreas appears within normal limits. the kidneys and adrenal glands appear within normal limits. there is no evidence of adenopathy. in comparison to the prior mri, the pleural effusions are diminished in size.

total left nephrectomy and partial right nephrectomy have been performed. there is a 2.3 x 2.3 cm tubular collection of fluid at the lateral aspect of the partial nephrectomy bed on the right. perinephric drain is noted adjacent to the inner inferior aspect of the remaining right kidney, with tip ending in the region of the renal hilum medially. on delayed post-contrast images, the right urinary collecting system fills appropriately with no evidence of active extravasation of gadolinium. there is no hydronephrosis or hydroureter. a slight kink in the proximal ureter is noted without associated caliber change. along the lateral aspect of the nephrectomy site, there is a linear distortion of an adjacent renal calix, which tapers in the linear fashion but does not show frank extravasation into the aforementioned small fluid collection at the nephrectomy site. as previously noted, there were multiple right renal cysts, but no suspicious enhancing renal mass lesions. the other abdominal organs including the visualized portions of the liver, spleen, pancreas, bowel loops, adrenal glands, stomach, and gallbladder, pancreas are normal. within the pelvis, foley catheter is noted within the bladder. bladder and other pelvic organs are normal. there is no free fluid.
this examination is limited significantly by patient motion. a moderate amount of intra-abdominal ascites is present. the liver has a nodular contour with enlargement of the left lobe, findings consistent with the patient's history of hepatitis c cirrhosis. gallbladder wall edema is present a finding also likely reflecting the patient's renal and hepatic dysfunction. assessment for mass lesions is limited by patient motion. there is loss of signal on t1-weighted out-of-phase imaging within the hepatic parenchyma, a finding that could reflect fatty infiltration versus iron deposition. the hepatic veins are patent. the portal vein is patent with flow in an appropriate direction. there is a standard right hepatic arterial anatomy with a replaced left hepatic artery originating from the left gastric (a finding confirmed on a contrast ct from ___). the right kidney measures 12.4 cm. the left kidney measures 14.0 cm with a duplicated left renal collecting system. there is no evidence of hydronephrosis. liver volume measured at 1786 cm3.
evidence of nodular siderosis of the liver with a few foci of dark t2 signal is noted. as before, the liver demonstrates diffuse internal nodularity and nodular contour with network of septal fibrotic bands that show increased t2 signal and delayed enhancement. the portal vein remains patent with normal direction of flow. no significant portosystemic collaterals are found, and there is no ascites. periportal and aortocaval lymphadenopathy is unchanged. two tiny gallstones within the gallbladder are redemonstrated. the biliary tree is otherwise normal. previously identified small wedge-shaped peripheral perfusion abnormality with associated 4mm nodule in segment vi of the liver is no longer visualized. a 9- mm nodule that shows relative ___ most pronounced on delayed images within segment vii is unchanged. no new nodules or lesions suspicious for hepatocellular carcinoma are identified. simple left renal cyst is again noted. kidneys are otherwise normal. the spleen is mildly enlarged. the pancreas, stomach, adrenal glands, and bowel loops are unremarkable. multiplanar reformatted images were essential in delineating the anatomy.

mra abdomen: the suprarenal abdominal aorta is normal in caliber. the origins and proximal portions of the sma and celiac artery are widely patent. bilateral renal arteries are widely patent without significant stenoses. there is mild atherosclerotic plaque within the infrarenal aorta without significant stenosis or aneurysm.
there is a large mass arising from the lower pole of the left kidney, which measures 9.5 x 10.0 x 8.7 cm. this lesion is of heterogeneous signal intensity on t1- and t2-weighted images. the majority of this mass enhances after the administration of gadolinium. the proximal aspect of the left renal vein contains thrombus, though this does not appear to be occlusive. the more distal aspect of the left renal vein and inferior vena cava appear to be patent. there is very extensive retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, which extends into the pelvis. the abdominal aorta is surrounded by enlarged lymph nodes. there is a single left renal artery, which is patent. a single right renal artery is also identified. within the liver, there is a large geographic area of low signal intensity on t1-weighted images and high signal intensity on t2-weighted images. this measures 6.3 x 3.6 x 8.0 cm. there is peripheral puddling of contrast within this region in the right hepatic lobe on the arterial phase images, and there is gradual filling in of this area on the more delayed sequences. these findings are compatible with a hemangioma. also noted is a smaller area with similar imaging features more superiorly at the level of the dome. the liver is otherwise unremarkable. the spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are unremarkable. no osseous abnormalities are identified. within the posterior subcutaneous tissues, just to the left of the spine and at the level of the large left renal mass, there is a 15 mm focus of enhancement. this may represent residual inflammatory changes from a prior biopsy. however, metastatic disease cannot be excluded. the multiplanar reformations were critical in delineating the above findings.
there is an 11.0 x 11.7 x 10.4 cm heterogeneously enhancing mass arising from the mid left kidney. this mass has a large necrotic center. it demonstrates regions of signal drop out on out-of-phase sequences, suggesting intravoxel fat. findings are consistent with a renal cell carcinoma, likely a clear cell given the presence of intravoxel fat. this mass is multilobated with probable invasion of the perirenal fat. in addition, there is possible extension to the posterior flank wall. there is no evidence for renal vein invasion. of note, there is a large retroaortic left renal vein, which is formed by the confluence of 2 large extra-pelvic renal veins approximately 3.5 cm proximal to the ivc. no renal vein tumor. large retroperitoneal collateral veins were seen as well. single renal arteries are identified bilaterally. lung bases show small bilateral effusions and bibasilar atelectasis. no focal liver lesions are identified. the gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are unremarkable. the visualized bowel is normal, and there is no significant free fluid or lymphadenopathy. several hemangiomas are incidentally noted throughout the lumbar spine and sacrum.
evaluation was limited because of artifact from two tips stents and embolization coils. however, the extra-hepatic bile ducts are normal in caliber and there are no filling defects within the common bile duct or common hepatic duct. gallstone seen on ct from ___ within the gallbladder neck is now within the cystic duct just below the gallbladder neck. this is the only stone seen within the biliary system. the gallbladder is normal in size and has homogeneous t2 bright bile within it. as before, there is gallbladder wall thickening which has been seen on both the ___ and ___ cts. gallbladder wall thickening is a nonspecific finding and likely relates to patient's chronic liver disease and hypoalbuminemia, though other causes can not be excluded. as before, the liver contour is nodular, and there is evidence of hepatic fibrosis and volume redistribution, all consistent with cirrhosis. the portal vein is patent, seen well on the left, and the more medial tips stent has flow within it. no definite paraesophageal varices, however, the area is obscured secondary to prior embolization coils. there is splenomegaly. as before, there is large volume ascites. there is recanalization of the umbilical vein. no lesions of concern within the liver. there are small cysts within the liver. as before, there is a unilocular smooth-walled cyst within the tail of the pancreas measuring 2 x 2.6 x 1.8 cm, not definitely changed in size. it has no definite enhancement, though evaluation is limited secondary to susceptibility artifact from embolization coil. attention can be paid to this on followup studies. right lower lobe rounded pulmonary consolidation with enhancement has a configuration suggestive of rounded atelectasis, as on recent ct. small right pleural effusion. two peripheral wedge-shaped lesions within the spleen are hyperintense on t2- weighted images, but do not have enhancement, unchanged in size from recent ct scans. no definite adrenal abnormalities. the kidneys have normal corticomedullary differentiation and are without focal lesion in their visualized portions. lymphadenopathy seen on recent ct scan is not as well demonstrated within the mesentery on this study secondary to susceptibility artifact from embolization clips. there are multiple left paraaortic lymph nodes measuring up to a centimeter in short axis, which are nonspecific. no concerning marrow lesions. multiplanar reformats were helpful in evaluation of the vessels and liver.
no focal hepatic lesions are seen on this non-contrast study. there is a small fluid signal intensity structure within the porta hepatis, corresponding to the finding on the prior abdominal ultrasound. this likely represents a hypoplastic gallbladder. there is no intra- or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. the spleen is unremarkable. there is loss of the normal acinar pattern of the pancreas diffusely. the pancreas is of increased signal intensity on stir images, and these findings are compatible with pancreatitis. there is a small amount of fluid surrounding the pancreas. the adrenal glands appear normal. several cystic structures are seen in both kidneys, one of which probably contains proteinaceous or hemorrhagic products in the upper pole of the right kidney. these cystic structures are incompletely characterized without intravenous contrast. there is a small amount of ascites. the bone marrow is unremarkable in signal intensity characteristics.
there has been interval increase in the size of the multiple liver metastases. for example, the largest right lobe metastasis which previously measured 6.3 cm now measures 7.5 cm in greatest dimension. the majority of these metastases have shown interval growth of at least several millimeters. most of them now demonstrate increasing necrotic centers. two large dominant enhancing pancreatic masses are again identified, also showing slight interval growth. multiple tiny enhancing and nonenhancing masses are identified throughout the pancreas. there has also been interval increase in the degree of pancreatic duct dilatation, now measuring approximately 6 mm were previously measured 4 to 5 mm in diameter. there has been slight interval increase of the right adrenal mass, now measuring 20 x 23 mm were previously measured 18 x 20 mm. there is increasing necrosis centrally within this mass. the left adrenal gland is not definitively identified. there has been a minimal increase in the size of the heterogeneous mass in the left perirenal space, measuring up to 4.3 cm in greatest dimension. multiple bilateral enhancing renal lesions are again identified. the majority of these lesions are stable in appearance although some have minimally increased in size. of note, there is a large infiltrative mass centrally within the left kidney, which extends into the renal sinus and into the left renal vein and ivc. overall, the size and degree of venous invasion of the left renal mass has not significantly changed. there has been interval increase in the size of the spinal canal mass at the level of t12-l1. this enhancing mass now measures up to 18 mm were previously measured 8 mm and has a nonenhancing necrotic center. this likely is a hemangioblastoma. if clinically idicated, a dedicated spine mri can be performed for further evaluation.
since the prior mri, the degree of fatty infiltration within the liver has markedly decreased, and there is now minimal signal drop out in the liver on the out-of-phase images. the region of suspected focal fatty deposition on the prior ct scan in the left lobe of liver medially is faintly visible today, appears smaller in the interval, and does not enhance following gadolinium, thus consistent with focal fatty deposition. no other focal liver lesions are seen. the spleen is at the upper limits of normal in size at 13 cm. a splenule is present. the pancreas, gallbladder, adrenal glands, and kidneys are within normal limits. a small aortocaval lymph node measuring 6 mm in greatest short axis dimension is noted, which appears smaller than on the prior study. no other lymph nodes are visible. there is no ascites. the aorta is normal in caliber. incidentally noted within the spine are small hemangiomas within the mid and lower thoracic vertebral bodies. bilateral mid abdominal ostomies are noted. multiplanar reformatted images were essential in assessing anatomy from various perspectives.

abdominal mra: the aorta is normal in caliber, without evidence for significant atherosclerotic disease. there are single normal appearing renal arteries bilaterally. the celiac axis, sma and ___ are also widely patent. there is minimal narrowing at the proximal right common iliac artery. the left common iliac artery is normal.
study is limited due to patient's inability to hold breath (patient is vented), patient's body habitus, and third spacing of fluid. there are two renal arteries on the right and two renal arteries on the left. a tiny accessory artery supplies the lower pole of the right kidney and a tiny accessory artery supplies the lower pole of the left kidney. no significant stenosis is identified. both kidneys enhance symmetrically. a few tiny simple cysts are noted within each kidney. there is no hydronephrosis. there are bilateral pleural effusions, incompletely evaluated. there is a large amount of ascites, diffuse anasarca, and periportal edema. a partially visualized liver, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are unremarkable. there is no significant lymphadenopathy within the visualized abdomen.

there is a moderate amount of ascites fluid present. note is made of edematous omentum anterior to the liver without definite infiltrate of disease. examination of the liver demonstrates normal signal intensity. on the current examination, there is normal hepatopetal flow of the main portal vein, which reflects a change compared to the doppler ultrasound performed 2 days ago. no focal hepatic lesions are evident. spleen is mild- to moderately- enlarged. pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable. a focus of layering low t2 signal at the dependent portion of the gallbladder may represent small amount of sludge. note is made of bilateral atelectasis. 1.9-cm lung nodule is again noted at the right lower lobe, as described on prior ct. recanalization of the paraumbilical veins is also noted.
as in the recent ct scan, there is a large amount of perihepatic hematoma. its size has not significantly changed when compared to the prior ct examination (please note images were degraded by respiratory motion). within segment 8 of the liver, there are three irregularly shaped, hypointense areas of parenchymal hemorrhage, measuring up to 2.3 cm in diameter. no underlying lesion can be identified in the region of the parenchymal hemorrhages. furthermore, comparison with multiple prior contrast-enhanced ct examinations showed no evidence for a liver lesion in this region. clinical correlation is recommended to determine the cause of bleed (question prior interventions?). no evidence for active contrast extravasation. the gallbladder and spleen are unremarkable. the pancreatic duct is diffusely dilated, unchanged from prior examinations. the pancreatic parenchyma is normal in signal intensity and there is no evidence for peripancreatic fluid to suggest acute pancreatitis. the adrenal glands are unremarkable. the right kidney is slightly displaced inferiorly by the liver. visualized renal parenchyma is otherwise unremarkable. the visualized arteries are grossly unremarkable, without evidence for aneurysm formation.
mri of the chest demonstrates an extensive aneurysm of the descending thoracic aorta which begins just distal to the takeoff of the left subclavian artery. in the coronal plane, this measures at least 11.1 cm in diameter. axial dimensions are somewhat difficult to obtain. there is an extensive amount of thrombus seen throughout the aneurysm, with areas of focal ulceration within the thrombus as well. no dissection flap is seen. this large thoracic aneurysm displaces the heart towards the right and also demonstrates compressive atelectatic changes of the surrounding lung. there is also displacement of the left pulmonary arteries with a lower lobe pulmonary artery draped around the aneurysm. there is a small to moderate- sized left pleural effusion. the descending thoracic aorta is markedly tortuous and is aneurysmal down to the level of the diaphragmatic hiatus. at the diaphragmatic hiatus, the coronal diameter of the aneurysm measures approximately 2.7 cm. the branch vessels of the aortic arch are all normal in appearance with no evidence of aneurysmal dilation or dissection. there is aneurysmal dilation seen of the suprarenal abdominal aorta with its greatest diameter measuring approximately 4.1 cm in the coronal plane. thrombus is again noted within the suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with no evidence of a dissection flap. the aorta then tapers to more normal caliber measuring approximately 1.6 cm just superior to the renal arteries and again demonstrates aneurysmal dilation in the infrarenal portion measuring up to approximately 5.3 cm in the coronal plane. thrombus formation is again seen within the infrarenal abdominal aorta. additionally, there appears to be thrombus of varying signal intensity suggesting varying stages of thrombus formation. both the right and left renal arteries appear uninvolved. there appears to be a second smaller accessory renal artery supplying the upper pole of the left kidney. the distal infrarenal abdominal aorta is normal in caliber proximal to the iliac bifurcation measuring approximately 1 cm. the origin of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries are normal in appearance. small focal areas of increased signal intensity on the true fisp images are seen within both right and left kidney consistent with simple cysts. the largest is an exophytic cyst along the lower pole of the left kidney measuring 1.5 x 2.0 cm. the liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenals, kidneys, and visualized intra-abdominal large and small bowel are otherwise normal in appearance. soft tissue and osseous signal intensity is normal. 3d multiplanar reformatted images were reviewed and confirm the above findings.
two tiny simple cysts (measuring 3-4 mm) are identified within the liver. otherwise, no focal liver lesions are identified. there is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation. no filling defects are seen within the bile ducts to suggest parasitic infestation. gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable. visualized bowel is normal and there is no significant lymphadenopathy. previously identified free fluid in the abdomen has resolved.

as seen on the prior studies, there is a small lesion at the posterior right hemidiaphragm. given differences in technique, it is probably not significantly changed in size from the prior mri and currently measures 17 x 14 x 7 mm. the mass is hypointense to the adjacent liver on both the t1- and t2-weighted images. there are no findings to suggest the presence of fat within this lesion. after the administration of contrast, there is low level enhancement, which is seen best on the most delayed phase. the lesion appears to be separate from the liver and is most likely arising either from the hemidiaphragm or pleura. overall, the imaging features are most consistent with a fibrous lesion. the examination is otherwise unremarkable. the 4 mm nodule seen on the prior ct scans is not clearly identified on the thin section mri images. it appears that this nodule is separate from the fibrous lesion described previously, and any further followup for this pulmonary nodule should be done by ct. the multiplanar reformations were helpful in evaluating the lesion's relationship to the liver and diaphragm.
the hepatic trisegmentectomy and hepaticojejunostomy are again evident. surgical resection margins are well preserved, though there is a questionable area of enhancement at the anterior hepatic surgical margin, along the left lobe. within segment iii, there is a lesion demonstrating increased t2 signal with ring enhancement on dynamic t1 images, newly developed compared to the previous examination. there is no intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation. the portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. again evident are two periportal lymph nodes, not significantly changed in size. the pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys appear within normal limits. no osseous abnormalities are noted. multiplanar reformatons demonstated dynamic features of the lesion and defined the rim for characterization.
diffuse atherosclerotic changes are seen with heaped up atherosclerotic plaques throughout the abdominal aorta and also showing incidental high-grade bilateral stenoses of the common iliac arteries. the right kidney shows normal enhancement and good corticomedullary distinction and shows an eccentric plaque at the origin of the right renal artery. this is best visualized on axial images (series 100, image 20). the plaque results in a borderline lesion with about 50% stenosis. the left kidney is supplied by two renal arteries. the superior left renal artery has a high- grade stenosis over its proximal 1.3 cm and clearly shows atrophy of the upper pole with relative hypoperfusion when compared to the lower pole. the lower pole supplied by a separate renal artery originating about 4 cm below the origin of the right renal artery. this shows a slight narrowing at its origin but the lower pole of the left kidney shows much thicker cortex and good corticomedullary distinction compared to its upper pole. the celiac artery origin also shows a tight stenosis. the sma is widely patent. there are bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis incidentally noted. the liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are within normal limits. the gallbladder and bile ducts are unremarkable. visualized bowel loops appear normal as well.

this study is severely limited in quality due to patient motion as well as artifact. the bolus rate was limited to 0.8 ml per second, as the patient's only venous access was a central catheter. at the proximal aspect of the celiac artery is unremarkable on both the fiesta and post-contrast images. however, evaluation of the proximal aspect of the superior mesenteric artery is severely limited. it is not clear whether the poor contrast opacification of the proximal sma is due to a true stenosis or artifact. the imaged portion of the liver is grossly unremarkable. there is no intra- or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. no splenic abnormality is seen. the evaluation of the pancreas is limited, though no gross abnormality is seen. the native kidneys are atrophic. there is hydronephrosis of the transplant kidney in the left lower quadrant, though the transplant is incompletely imaged. this finding does not appear to be significantly changed from the recent ct of ___. the imaged bowel loops show no gross abnormality. there is no significant dilatation and no areas of abnormal wall thickening are appreciated. the reformatted images were helpful in attempting to define the vascular anatomy.
there is a left adrenal mass, which measures 3.7 x 3.1 x 3.5 cm. this lesion is predominantly isointense to muscle on t1- and t2-weighted images. however, the appearance is more heterogeneous on the t2-weighted images, with areas of higher signal intensity within it. overall, this lesion is stable in size from the most recent mri of ___, though this lesion has slowly grown in size when compared to prior studies dating back to ___. in ___, the coronal dimension of this lesion was 2.8 cm, compared with 3.5 cm today. the lesion is well circumscribed and not changed in morphology from prior studies. there is a small enhancing focus within it. this lesion has a somewhat more heterogeneous appearance on the out-of-phase images compared with the in-phase images, as some areas within the mass drop in signal intensity. overall, these areas of lower signal intensity on the out-of-phase images correspond with areas of low attenuation on prior ct studies, and these findings are most consistent with an adenoma. the right adrenal gland is unremarkable. the liver is not fully imaged, as the study was targeted through the adrenal glands. however, several small hepatic cysts are again seen. there is a lesion within segment iv, which is unchanged in size from the prior study and has imaging features classic for a hemangioma. there is a replaced right hepatic artery from the sma as well as an accessory left hepatic artery from the left gastric artery. all of the hepatic arteries are large in caliber. the portal vein is patent, though the left portal vein is very small in caliber. after the administration of contrast, there is very heterogeneous enhancement of the liver. none of these areas of heterogeneous enhancement appear mass-like and metastatic disease in these locations is considered unlikely. the hepatic veins are not fully included on this study, though they were patent on the most recent mri from ___. the gallbladder, imaged portion of the spleen, pancreas, and kidneys are unremarkable. there is no pathologic lymphadenopathy. there is scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine, convex to the left, centered at l2.

mri abdomen after the administration of iv gadolinium: the images are somewhat limited secondary to motion artifact. there is mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. susceptibility artifact associated with pneumobilia is seen within the left-sided biliary radicles. the bopta-filled intrahepatic bile ducts are seen extending to the region of the hilum, and there is an air-fluid level along the path of the ptc catheter, with the fluid component having increased t1 signal consistent with the gadolinium-bopta excretion. this is again most suggestive of a biliary- enteric anastomosis. as the course of the biliary catheter is followed into the small bowel, no t1- hyperintense lesion corresponding to that of question from yesterday's examination is seen.
a stent obscures evaluation of the left renal artery. the right renal artery is patent. the abdominal aorta demonstrates mild to moderate irregularity.
in the left pelvis, adjacent to the sigmoid colon, there is a 6.3 cm ap x 5.1 cm tv x 6.4 cm si air-fluid collection with a thick wall, which has decreased in size since the examination of ___ (9.2 cm ap x 7.4 cm tv x 9.2 cm si). there is improvement in left hydronephrosis, with only very minimal calyceal blunting on today's examination. no hydroureter is seen. the liver is cirrhotic with nodular contour, and gallbladder wall edema is present. a small amount of pelvic-free fluid is seen on today's examination as well. diffuse diverticulosis is seen. tarlov's cysts are seen on the left. within the limitations of this examination, the right kidney, adrenal glands, spleen, pancreas, stomach, and small bowel appear unremarkable. degenerative vertebral changes are seen.
the right kidney shows a perinephric collection which exerts mass effect upon its lateral border. there are areas on pre-contrast that show markedly hyperintense signal consistent with hemorrhage. the size of this perinephric hematoma is 10.3 cm in maximum dimension x 4.8 cm in the perpendicular measurement to the prior. post-contrast images including subtraction imaging reveal contrast extravasation at the lateral border of the kidney at a point that appears to indent medially (see images 73-75 of series 300). i was unable to identify an angiomyolipoma or enhancing renal mass which might have been a source of these findings. the delayed contrast images show slight increased accumulation of contrast, but not a substantial change over time. the right renal artery is widely patent except for the proximal most portion which is unable to be accurately assessed due to stent artifact. perpendicular reformations showed no evidence of intimal flap within the majority of the visualized right renal artery, the entire renal artery distal to the stent. the renal parenchyma shows normal enhancement with corticomedullary distinction and subsequent filling in on delayed images. there is a suggestion of some impaired renal function as there is not a substantial amount of contrast excretion into the collecting system, which is expected with normal renal function. the patient is status post left nephrectomy with remote history of cancer and there is no evidence of enhancing tumor in the left nephrectomy bed. the pancreas is normal and drapes into this postoperative bed as is typically seen following such operations. the aorta is normal in caliber throughout. the celiac axis and sma are widely patent without significant disease. the ___ origin is also well seen and appears normal. visualized bowel loops are unremarkable and the liver, spleen, gallbladder and bile ducts are normal. multiplanar reformations were essential in the assessment of the perinephric hematoma and in ruling out renal artery dissection.
the liver is small and shrunken, especially in relation to the right lobe. the left lobe as well as the caudate lobes are prominent and the appearances are consistent with cirrhosis. on the t2-weighted images on the haste sequence, note is made of some poorly-defined focal areas of increased signal intensity. no mass effect identified. these changes are not identified and do not persist on the post-contrast images. the appearances are not specific but may be consistent with edema. this appearance may be seen secondary to infection or rejection. no focal enhancing areas in relation to the liver parenchyma. no significant change when compared with the previous mri from ___. there is significant ascites present in the abdomen especially in the perihepatic area. note is made of retroperitoneal collateral vessels as well as splenic and gastric varices. in relation to the liver, the portal vein is patent and the flow is centripetal. note is made of a small non-occlusive thrombus in the portal vein which does not compromise the lumen of this vessel. the hepatic veins are patent. this patient is status post cholecystectomy. the right kidney is visualized and measures 10.5 cm in maximum length. left kidney is visualized and measures 10.3 cm in maximum length. no focal lesions in relation to the kidneys. there is splenomegaly with the spleen measuring 18 cm in maximum length. multiplanar 2d and 3d reformations provided multiple perspectives for the dynamic series.
images of the lungs demonstrate a right lower lobe pulmonary artery embolus beginning st the origin of the suoerior segment artery and extending into the remainder of the lower lobe artery; the basal segmental branches are reconstituted. it is uncertain whether this is bland or tumor thrombus. within the lower pole of the left kidney, there is a large infiltrating mass which measures approximately 8.9 x 7.9 x 11.9 cm in transverse by ap x craniocaudad dimensions respectively. this replaces the central sinus and the entire lower pole and interpolar region of the kidney, and compresses the collecting system. there is no evidence for invasion of gerota's fascia. there are retroperitoneal collateral veins and arteries. there are shotty paraaortic lymph nodes with one left enlarged node 12 mm in short axis. the renal tumor fills and distends the left renal vein, and extends into the ivc. the tumor terminates approximately 4 cm below the hepatic confluence within the liver. there appears to be some bland thrombus at the tip of the tumor thrombus superiorly. the left kidney measures approximately 17 cm in length. incidental note is made of a 1.2 x 1.2 cm simple cyst within the superior pole of the left kidney as well as an exophytic 2.9 x 2.9 cm simple cyst off the inferior pole of the left kidney. there are single renal arteries bilaterally with a mild-moderate stenosis in the proximal right renal artery. the right kidney measures 13.7 cm in length and contains a simple 7 x 6.2 x 7 cm in ap by transverse by cc dimension, respectively. an incidental note is made of a duodenal diverticulum near the cbd. there is stable intrahepatic biliary dilatation within the left lobe of the liver and chd and cbd dilation compared to ___ mri. the liver, adrenals, pancreas, spleen are unremarkable. there is no abdominal ascites. multiplanar 2d and 3d reformations were essential in demonstrating multiple perspectives for this dynamic series.
bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, unchanged from the prior study. there is a small pericardial effusion with possible pericardial enhancement post-gadolinium administration. the significance of this finding is unknown and linical correlation is recommended. the liver is atrophic with a background of innumerable nodules surrounded by extensive fibrosis. there is no biliary duct dilatation. there are no focal arterial enhancing lesions. the spleen shows heterogeneous enhancement likely related to portal hypertension. there is a tiny 7-mm cystic lesion projecting anteriorly through the main pancreatic duct in the body of the pancreas, unchanged from prior studies back to ___. otherwise the pancreas is unremarkable. the adrenal glands, left kidney, and gallbladder are unremarkable. the right kidney is atrophic, unchanged from prior studies. the proximal main portal vein and the right portal veins are attenuated but patent. there is a very thin vessel within the left lobe that may represent a recanalized left portal vein, however, we cannot see connection with the main portal vein. the superior mesenteric is attenuated but patent. the splenic vein is widely patent. there are extensive varices within the abdomen as well as esophageal varices. there is a large amount of ascites throughout the abdomen. 3d reconstructions were helpful in the delineation of anatomy and pathology.
again seen is a complex cystic mass in the left upper pole with septations and nodular areas of enhancement. the cystic portion of this lesion measures approximately 1.9 x 1.9 x 2.0 cm in the ap/transverse/craniocaudal dimensions (previously 1.5 x 2.0 1.6 cm). however, the nodular enhancing component of the lesion has an area of approximately ___ sq mm, which is essentially unchanged from the prior examination. there is symmetric enhancement and excretion of contrast material within the kidneys bilaterally. no new renal mass is identified. there is no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. there are several small parapelvic cysts bilaterally. there is a small amount of sludge within the gallbladder. the liver, pancreas, gallbladder, spleen, adrenals, intra-abdominal large and small bowel, and intra-abdominal vasculature are otherwise normal. osseous structures demonstrate mild scoliosis of the lumbar spine convex to the left. osseous and soft tissue signal is unremarkable. 3d multiplanar reformatted images confirm the above findings.
the study is slightly limited secondary to the patient's large volume of ascites. the liver is slightly shrunken and has a markedly nodular contour consistent with cirrhosis. the portal vein is patent and has hepatopetal flow. there are no focal dominant liver lesions. no abnormal enhancement on arterial phase imaging or other findings to suggest hepatocellular carcinoma. there is mild splenomegaly with the spleen measuring 14.6 cm in craniocaudal span. there are large paraesophageal and gastric varices. with massive ascites, the patient has all major sequela of portal hypertension. no significant perihepatic lymphadenopathy. there are multiple small gallstones dependently within the gallbladder. gallbladder wall is mildly thickened, likely related to liver failure. no intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. no filling defects within the bile ducts to suggest choledocholithiasis. pancreas is normal in signal characteristics and contour. the main pancreatic duct is not dilated. no evidence of pancreatic lesions. the adrenal glands are normal in appearance bilaterally. other than a simple renal cyst, the kidneys are normal in appearance. no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. no concerning marrow lesions. there is minimal atelectasis at the lung bases. no large pericardial or pleural effusions. multiplanar reformats and subtraction images were helpful in evaluating the liver and organs of the upper abdomen.
examination is somewhat limited due to patient's inability to hold his breath. multiple large, necrotic lesions are visualized within the liver parenchyma, most notably in segments v and vi of the liver. these demonstrate peripheral ring-like enhancement and central necrosis. on stir imaging, these lesions are associated with hyperemia and peripheral av shunting. there is a single hyperemic rounded lesion in segment v of the liver, which measures approximately 1 cm, which is more characteristic of a hypervascular metastasis. however, the degree of hyperemia associated with the remainder of the hepatic lesions is more characteristic for abscesses. unfortunately, neither imaging characteristic is diagnostic for an abscess versus metastatic disease, and correlation with clinical presentation and/or biopsy may be required to differentiate. there is clip artifact in the region of the smv where it joins in with the portal vein, and a thrombus in the portal vein cannot be excluded on these limited quality images. further evaluation of these venous structures with a pancreatic cta is recommended in order to evaluate for smv/portal venous thrombosis. there are bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left. there is diffuse ascites throughout the abdomen. multiplanar 2d and 3d reformations were essential in demonstrating multiple characteristics for this dynamic series.
there are bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left with interval increase in size on the right, and interval decrease in size on the left. again noted is a small pericardial effusion. the liver is cirrhotic with diffuse fibrosis. there is no evidence for any arterial phase enhancing lesion. there is no biliary dilatation or cbd enlargement. incidentally noted is a small gallstone within the gallbladder. the main portal vein and right portal vein are again noted to be attenuated, but they are patent and demonstrate hepatopetal flow. the left portal vein is better visualized on the current examination than on the prior, with attenuation in size and hepatopetal flow. the smv and the splenic vein are also noted to be patent. there are diffuse paraesophageal and coronary varices along with diffuse ascites throughout the abdomen. the spleen is enlarged, measuring 16.4 cm in craniocaudad dimension and demonstrates several gamna-gandy bodies within it. again visualized within the pancreas is an approximately 1-cm cystic lesion, unchanged in size in comparison to the prior examination. the right kidney is atrophic. the left kidney is unremarkable. the adrenal glands are unremarkable. multiplanar 2d and 3d reformations were able to provide multiple perspectives for this dynamic series.
study is severely limited due to patient's condition. there is no dilatation of the intra- or extrahepatic biliary tree. small non=-occlusive biliary stones cannot be excluded. the cbd is visualized into the region of the pancreatic head and normal in caliber. there is diffuse anasarca. there is mild ascites. there are small bilateral pleural effusions with associated bibasilar atelectasis. 2 cm oval well circumscribed lesion with hyperintensity on t2-0weighted images in the upper pole of the right kidney is incompletely evaluated but without concerning features on this limited evaluation. the spleen is mildly enlarged measuring 15.3 cm. both adrenal glands are normal. no focal intraabdominal collections are identified.
images of the lung bases demonstrate a right-sided pleural effusion and an elevated right hemidiaphragm. there is diffuse enlargement of the liver with multiple ill-defined parenchymal infiltrates throughout the liver. the biliary tree demonstrates peripheral enhancement throughout the liver, compatible with cholangitis. also noted are multiple peribiliary cysts. additionally, there is a 1.5 cm isolated ring- enhancing lesion, probably an abscess, in segment v of the liver. there is mild intra- hepatic biliary dilatation; in addition there are several gallstones visualized within the gallbladder and a 7 mm stone within the distal cbd. the most dilated portion of the common bile duct measures 9 mm immediately proximal to this stone. siderotic nodules are also visualized throughout the liver. there are enlarged periportal and portocaval lymph nodes. the ill- defined parenchymal infiltrates visualized throughout the liver may be compatible with edema secondary to the above-mentioned cholangitis; however, a diffusely infiltrative hepatoma cannot be excluded and repeat mri scan of the liver without and with contrast is recommended once the patient's clinical situation improves. the previously visualized 1.5 cm cystic pancreatic body lesion seen on the ct scan demonstrate some suspicious features, specifically three septa which appear to enhance. this is most compatible with an intraductal papillary mucinous tumor and one year followup is recommended to assess for stability. there is no dilatation of the pancreatic duct and no other pancreatic lesions/ masses are visualized. the adrenal glands, kidneys and, spleen are unremarkable. there is diffuse edema throughout the mesentery and in the soft tissues. multiplanar 2d and 3d reformations were essential in demonstrating multiple perspectives for this dynamic series.
there is a 30 x 24 mm exophytic lesion in the lower pole of the right kidney unchanged in size and enhancing features. is hyperintense in t2- weighted images, hypointense in t1-weighted images and shows enhancement of nearly the entire lesion on more delayed images. this is concerning for renal cell carcinoma. no extension into the perirenal fat evident. the renal vein is patent. within the lower pole of the left kidney there is a 13 x 10- mm exophytic cystic lesion with thin septation without solid nodular enhancing component. stable bilateral simple renal cyst. there is no hydronephrosis. there is no lymphadenopathy. there is an unchanged mild intra- and extra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation. the spleen and pancreas are unremarkable. unchanged mild thickening of the left adrenal gland. there is no free fluid. unchanged bilateral tarlov cysts within the upper lumbar spine. no suspicious bony lesions. multiplanar reconstructions were helpful in evaluating the described findings.
the dominant cystic lesion in the lateral segment of the left hepatic lobe has increased in size, now measuring 9.3 x 9.1 x 9.7 cm (previously measuring less than 5 cm). it contains several internal septations and a thick enhancing wall with adjacent hyperemia, features consistent with hepatic abscess. the previously noted lesion in segment vii has decreased in size, measuring up to 1.4 cm. a third potential lesion in hepatic segment vi is only identified in the delayed enhancement phase, measuring 1.3 x 0.8 cm. it is not definitely identified in the previous study. again noted is the background of numerous hepatic cysts without concerning enhancement features. the hepatic vascularity remains patent. the edema in the gallbladder has markedly diminished. the spleen is unremarkable. a cyst in the tail of the pancreas is again noted. the parenchyma of both native kidneys is again largely replaced with innumerable cysts, some of which appear to contain hemorrhagic or proteinaceous material. a small right pleural effusion persists. a large pericardial effusion remains similar in appearance. degenerative changes of the spine are again noted. 3d and multiplanar reconstructions were essential in evaluation of the hepatic lesions. findings of the larger left hepatic lobe cystic lesion were discussed with dr. ___ ___ on ___ at 9:55 a.m.
diffuse moderate atherosclerotic disease of the infrarenal aorta is present. mild diffuse disease of the renal arteries is present without definite flow- limiting stenosis.
findings: in relation to the lower pole of the left kidney medially, there is a solid mass, which is of relatively low signal intensity pre-contrast and demonstrates avid homogenous enhancement post-contrast. this measures 3.1 cm in transverse x 2.9 cm in ap x 3.3 cm in craniocaudal dimensions. it is abutting the left lower pole calix. no other lesions in relation to the left kidney are identified. the left renal vein and ivc are normal. the appearances are consistent with a left renal cell carcinoma. the single left renal artery is normal. the right kidney is normal. two renal arteries supply the right kidney. the upper renal artery bifurcates. there is some mild narrowing of the upper right renal artery beyond the ostium. the lower pole left renal artery is widely patent. the liver and spleen are normal. the pancreas is unremarkable. the adrenals are normal. no evidence of any significant lymphadenopathy. multiplanar 2d and 3d reformations provided multiple perspectives for the dynamic series.
there is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation. the extrahepatic common bile duct is visualized to the level of the pancreatic head, and is normal in appearance and caliber. a large amount of susceptibility artifact in the region of the second and third portions of the duodenum are related to prior embolization coils. the pancreatic head is therefore poorly visualized, but where visualized the pancreatic duct is normal. the liver enhances normally. 1 to 2 mm peripherally located, arterially enhancing lesions concentrated in segment ivb are likely related to perfusion abnormalities. a small amount of perihepatic fluid is noted. the gallbladder, visualized pancreas (body, and tail) spleen, and bilateral adrenals glands are unremarkable. there is a 9.9 mm cyst in the interpolar left kidney, and a 4 mm cyst in the interpolar right kidney. there is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. there is no free air and no free fluid. the visualized loops of bowel are unremarkable. no bony lesions are visualized. multiplanar 2d and 3d reformations provided multiple perspectives for the dynamic series.
a right suprarenal mass is seen, measuring 10.3 cm ap x 8.1 cm tv x 13.2 cm si, and which invades segment vi of the liver. a right adrenal vein is clearly seen draining from the center of this mass into the ivc, consistent with an adrenal origin. a very thin fat plane is seen between this mass and the right kidney, which has been pushed inferiorly and rotated by this mass. this mass extrinsically compresses the ivc, and there is no intraluminal component seen within the ivc, although invasion of the ivc wall cannot be excluded. the arterial supply for this mass is not clearly identified. multiple renal and hepatic cysts are seen. the left adrenal gland is normal. the right adrenal gland is not identified separately from the right suprarenal mass. the pancreas appears normal, and the spleen appears normal aside from a rotated morphology from that which is normally seen. review of multiplanar reformatted images at the time of interpretation confirm these findings.
there is nodular thickening of both adrenal glands, more prominent on the right than on the left. these both show marked drop of signal on the opposed-phased images, consistent with intravoxel fat. visualized portions of the liver, spleen, and pancreas appear unremarkable allowing for the technique. multiple renal cysts are present. there is bibasilar atelectasis.

scout images show soft tissue defect superficial to the sacrum, presumably representing decubitus ulcer. diffuse edema in the subcutaneous soft tissues of the back are likely related to chronic stasis/positioning. evaluation of the pancreatic head is difficult given the inability of the patient to complete the examination. however, on the axial and coronal ssfse images, there is preservation of the normal pancreatic parenchymal pattern, without suggestion of mass effect, displacement of the pancreatic duct, or pancreatic ductal dilatation. there is no evidence of intra- or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, although evaluation may be limited by the presence of the biliary stent. a large gallstone is present. a small amount of air is seen within the gallbladder, likely introduced from the recent ercp. a trace of free fluid is present within the abdomen. there is a 5-mm interpolar right renal focus, which is hyperintense on t2-weighted images, consistent with a tiny renal cyst. a large left-sided abdominal wall hernia is present, containing bowel and mesenteric fat. multiple foci of susceptibility along the ventral abdominal wall is consistent with surgical sutures as evident on the prior radiograph. a small amount of atelectasis and right-sided pleural fluid is also evident. there appears to be a foley catheter. the endometrium appears thickened for a patient of this age, probably 10 mm, although this examination is not tailored towards evaluation of the pelvis.
superior and lateral to the right kidney in the perinephric space is a 8 x 7.4 x 10.9 cm lesion (measured in greatest cross sectional extents) with predominantly low signal on t1 and intermediate signal on t2-weighted images with a few focal areas of increased signal on t1. no enhancement is identified on postcontrast images. this lesion wraps anteromedially around the right kidney and is contiguous with a small (approximately 1 cm) renal lesion. within and extending from the lesion is a tubular structure, likely a vessel. on out-of-phase chemical shift images, this lesion demonstrates signal loss when compared to in-phase images; also, when correlated with the prior ct (___-___), these areas measure fat attenuation. there is no evidence of hydronephrosis. the left kidney shows a few simple cysts, otherwise, there is no evidence of perinephric fluid collection, hydronephrosis, or solid renal mass. the adrenal glands appear unremarkable. multiple gallstones are identified within the gallbladder. a few cystic lesions are identified within the visualized portions of the liver; one of which has a crossing vessel or septa. the spleen appears unremarkable. the visualized portion of the pancreas appears within normal limits. no enlarged lymph nodes are identified. multiplanar reformatted images and subtraction images were essential in demonstrating the above findings.

the liver is cirrhotic, and demonstrates diffuse fatty infiltration. there is a well-defined mass containing a single thin septation in the dome of the liver, measuring 3.4 x 3.0 cm (sequence 9, image #165). the mass is low signal intensity on t1 and high signal intensity on t2- weighted sequences, and does not enhance, consistent with an hepatic cyst. no other discrete hepatic lesions are identified. there is no intra- or extra- hepatic biliary ductal dilatation. there is a discrete filling defect within the portal vein, extending from the portal confluence (sequence 18, image #333), and occluding the right portal vein. non-occlusive thrombus is also in the proximal portion of the left portal vein, although the distal portion is widely patent. the gallbladder is distended. there are no focal lesions in the pancreas. the spleen is mildly enlarged, measuring 15.0 cm in craniocaudal dimension but otherwise is normal. gastric varices are identified. there may be a recanalized umbilical vein, consistent with cirrhosis. the adrenal glands are normal. there is a 2.3 cm exophytic cyst at the upper pole of the right kidney and a 1.1 cm left renal cyst. otherwise, the kidneys are unremarkable. there is ascites. there are bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis. no discretely enlarged abdominal or retroperitoneal lymph nodes are identified. multiplanar reformatted sequences were essential in delineating the above findings. findings were discussed with house officer, dr. ___ ___.
a sharply marginated 1-cm left adrenal mass shows unequivocal drop in signal intensity on the out-of-phase t1-weighted sequence compared to the in-phase t1-weighted image. these findings are consistent with an adrenal adenoma. there is atrophy of the pancreas diffusely with areas of fatty atrophy as well. gallstones are incidentally noted and the biliary tract is nondilated. the pancreatic duct is within normal limits, nondilated. the visualized bowel loops are unremarkable and there are no solid liver or spleen lesions. the kidneys show no abnormality and no hydronephrosis. there is no significant adenopathy in the limited coverage area. of incidental note, the coronal haste images show some areas of high signal sharply circumscribed in the subcutaneous fat on the right just above the level of the umbilicus. these correspond to some soft tissue density seen on the ct of ___ and are likely the residual of subcutaneous injections. clinical correlation is recommended.
the liver is normal in size and morphology. within segment ___, there is a 5-mm arterially enhancing focus that does not washout on more delayed images. this finding is not appreciated on prior ct scans in the same area, and followup in six months is recommended to assess for persistence. there is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation. simple cysts are visualized in the hepatic parenchyma. evaluation of the pancreas demonstrates a stable 6-mm cystic lesion in the neck of the pancreas. a tiny cyst is seen immediately posterior to this lesion, not appreciated on prior cts. a 7-mm septated cystic lesion is seen in the pancreatic tail, not definitively seen on prior ct examinations. recommend short-term interval followup in six months to one year to assess for expected stability. the adrenal glands, kidneys, and spleen are unremarkable except for multiple tiny simple left-sided renal cysts. there are multiple portocaval and peripancreatic lymph nodes; unchanged. there is borderline splenomegaly, measuring 13 cm in maximal craniocaudad dimension. there is no evidence for abdominal ascites. the visualized small bowel is unremarkable. the osseous structures are unremarkable. multiplanar 2d and 3d reformations as well as subtraction images were essential in demonstrating multiple perspectives for this dynamic series.
there are at least four lesions demonstrating increased t2 signal intensity, and arterial enhancement in the liver consistent with metastatic foci. these were all present on the most recent prior examination, but have all increased in size and conspicuity. the first in segment iii now measures 14 x 15 mm (previously 9 x 11 mm). three other lesions are seen along the right border of the hepatic resection. the largest of these (series 100, image 43) measures 14 x 16 mm, previously approximately 9 x 10 mm. no definite new lesions are identified. several subcentimeter periportal lymph nodes are stable in appearance. there is no intrahepatic or biliary ductal dilation. the portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. the surgical anastomosis appears unremarkable. the pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are normal. osseous signal intensity is also normal. multiplanar reformatted images were reviewed on a separate workstation and confirmed the above findings.
the celiac artery and inferior mesenteric artery are widely patent proximally. the superior mesenteric artery is widely patent proximally, however, just distal to the first jejunal ___ in the mid portion of the artery is a stenosis approaching 50% with continuing irregularity of the distal superior mesenteric artery. the bilateral native renal arteries are patent though the native kidneys are nonvisualized. there is mild atherosclerotic irregularity of the distal aorta.
the right kidney measures approximately 7 cm in craniocaudad extent. the left kidney measures approximately 7.9 cm in craniocaudad extent. both kidneys are noted to be markedly atrophic with lack of cortical medullary differentiation. multiple simple cysts are seen in the right kidney, the largest measuring approximately 6.6 x 7.3 x 7.8 cm. in the left kidney, there are several hemorrhagic cysts which demonstrate high signal intensity on t1- and t2 weighted images, do not demonstrate enhancement after the administration of intravenous gadolinium. the left kidney is surrounded by a large perinephric hematoma. there is no active extravasation. no mass is seen in the left kidney- in particular, no aml or renal cell carcinoma is seen. simple renal arteries are visualized supplying both kidneys. the transplant kidney in the right lower quadrant demonstrates patent vascularity. there is a simple renal cyst within the upper pole of the transplant kidney. the liver is normal in size and morphology. there is no abnormal signal intensity within the liver. there is no intra- or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. the gallbladder is dilated. the pancreatic duct is unremarkable. the pancreas, adrenal glands, and spleen are unremarkable. there is no abnormal lymphadenopathy nor ascites within the abdomen and pelvis. evaluation of the osseous structures is unremarkable. multiplanar 2d and 3d reformations of the abdomen and pelvis were essential in demonstrating multiple perspectives for this dynamic series.
the examination is markedly limited due to patient inability to hold her breath but mostly due to the marked susceptibility artifact from coils in the gastroesophageal region. there are flow voids noted at the gastroesophageal region compatible with esophageal varices. there are bilateral layering pleural effusions, right greater than left. a small amount of ascites is visualized within the abdomen. the liver demonstrates a small and shrunken configuration, compatible with cirrhosis. the gallbladder is contracted. post-contrast images of the liver are markedly limited due to surrounding susceptibility artifact and sensitivity for detection of a focal lesion is low, therefore, a lesion in the liver cannot be excluded on the current examination and cta of the liver is recommended to better assess. the spleen is enlarged measuring 16.2 cm in maximal craniocaudad dimension. limited evaluation of bilateral adrenal glands and kidneys is unremarkable. there is a small amount of ascites as mentioned previously within the abdomen. the small and large bowel is within normal limits. endplate degenerative changes are seen within the lumbar spine. multiplanar 2d and 3d reformations of the liver are limited due to marked susceptibility artifact.
limited evaluation of the chest demonstrates diffuse pulmonary parenchymal disease, better characterized on prior ct evaluations. both liver and spleen demonstrate decreased signal on t1 in-phase images when compared to the outer phase images, and with this representing the later echo, these findings are consistent with iron deposition/hemosiderosis. this effect is not appreciated within the pancreas or substantially within bone marrow. pancreas divisum is again noted. the adrenal glands are unremarkable. the right kidney appears normal. arising from the interpolar to lower polar portion of the left kidney, a peripherally located, slighty exophytic, posteromedial solid renal lesion measuring approximately 12 mm ap x 14 mm tv x 14 mm si demonstrates essential isointensity to the renal parenchyma on t1- weighted images, slightly decreased signal on t2- weighted images, and low-grade homogeneous enhancement after the iv administration of gadolinium- dtpa. evaluation for the presence of macroscopic or microscopic fat on t1- weighted ideal imaging demonstrates no appreciable fat content within this lesion. no renal hilar adenopathy or retroperitoneal adenopathy is appreciated. no abdominal free fluid is present. multiplanar reformatted images, subtraction images, and volume-rendered images reviewed at the time of interpretation support these findings.
in segment vii of the liver (series 5, images 19 through 22), there are two focal hepatic lesions, the more posterior of which measures 1.2 cm, and the more superior and anterior of which measures 2.1 x 2.7 in maximal transverse x ap dimensions respectively. these two focal lesions demonstrate high signal on t2-weighted sequences and uniformly low signal on t1-weighted sequences. more superiorly within segment vii of the liver (series 5, images 16 through 18), there is a wedge shaped region of high signal intensity that is ill-defined. this wedge-shaped region of signal intensity is amorphous with low signal intensity on t1 and high signal intensity on t2-weighted sequences. evaluation of the portal vein on this non-contrast image is limited, however, there is no high signal intensity within the portal vein on the t1 or haste dark blood sequence to suggest an intraluminal filling defect. evaluation of the spleen demonstrates multiple focal high signal intensity lesions that suggest abscesses (see series 5, images 25,28 and 32). in the setting of both hepatic and splenic lesions, this combination of findings is most compatible with abscesses. evaluation of the gallbladder demonstrates a large amount of air, which is seen to bloom on longer te sequences, secondary to recent history of prior ercp. no obstructing stones are seen within the biliary tree. non-contrast evaluation of the pancreas, bilateral adrenal glands, and kidneys is unremarkable. there is no abdominal ascites. evaluation of the osseous structures is within normal limits.
the previously described fluid collection seen anterior to the left kidney extends slightly superiorly between the pancreatic tail and the stomach. on transverse images, this measures up to 2.3 x 2.9 cm, and on coronal images, this measures up to 3.8 cm. corresponding measurements made from the prior mr of ___ demonstrated measurements of up to 2.7 x 3.0 cm on transverse images, and up to 3.0 cm on the coronal images. the small foci of air seen within this collection have resolved since the prior study. a trace amount of abdominal free fluid is present, which represents a slight increase since the prior study. mild fullness of the left renal collecting system is seen extending to the level of the sacral prominence, consistent with hydronephrosis of pregnancy on the left. an 8-mm hyperintensity within the liver on ssfse images within segment vii likely represents a hemangioma, although not characterized with contrast. punctate cyst is also seen within segment vii, consistent with a cyst. evaluation of the liver, spleen, adrenal glands, right kidney, and spleen on these non-contrast images are unremarkable. the pancreas also appears unremarkable. no significant abdominal adenopathy is present. bilateral breast implants are present, with mild edema also seen around the implants.
the previously described macronodularity of the liver shows progression, with increase in number and size of the nodules. a dominant nodule in segment 6, subcapsular, has a maximal diameter of 16 mm (series 902, image 79). this nodule showed a maximal diameter of 6 mm on the prior exam. another dominant nodule in segment 6 shows a maximal diameter of 14 mm, on the prior exam 12 mm (series 902, image 70). the previously described dominant nodule in segment 8 shows the maximal diameter of 14 mm versus 11 mm on prior exam. in this area, there are multiple new macronodules with maximal diameter is up to 16 mm seen (series 902, image 33). the majority of these nodules are hyperenhancing on the early postcontrast images, some of the nodules do show washout on the dynamic series. on the precontrast images, the majority of these nodules are iso-to-hyper-intense to the liver parenchyma. the diffuse macronodular appearance the liver is compatible with sarcoid with the macro-nodules representing granulomas. however, hcc on the background of these hyperenhancing nodules cannot be excluded. the intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts and the gallbladder are unremarkable. the pancreas shows a normal acinous morphology, the main hepatic duct is not dilated. there is a status post splenectomy present. the adrenal glands are unremarkable. the kidneys are of normal size, show synchron enhancement with good corticomedullary distinction. the collecting system is unremarkable. there is a 15 mm retroperitoneal lymph nodes present just posterior to the uncinate process of the pancreas and anterolateral to the ivc. there is no ascites present. the visualized parts of the bowels are unremarkable. the lung bases are unremarkable. there are no osteolytic or osteoblastic lesions seen on the visualized osseous structures. the 2d and 3d subtraction and reconstruction images evaluated on a separate workstation were essential in the assessment of the nodules.
the visualized portion of the liver is normal. note is made of a small, 6-mm, cyst in the right hepatic lobe. no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation. the gallbladder is normal. the spleen is normal in size and appearance. at the pancreatic tail, there is a 3.0 x 2.7 cm fluid-filled structure (sequence 6, image #19) that demonstrates intermediate signal on t1-weighted sequences and high signal intensity on t2-weighted sequences, and notably, contains a small low signal focus in its non-dependent portion (sequence 6, image #20). this finding most likely represents susceptibility artifact, from a small focus of gas. the adjacent pancreas demonstrates suggestion of mild edema, likely secondary to pancreatitis. no significant peripancreatic inflammatory changes or pancreatic ductal dilatation. there is mild bilateral hydronephrosis, left greater than right, likely related to pregnancy. otherwise, the kidneys are normal in size and appearance. an ileostomy is noted in the right abdomen in this patient with prior colectomy. post-surgical changes are seen at the abdominal midline. there is a small amount of perihepatic fluid and a small amount of fluid in the paracolic gutters and in the pelvis. there is an intrauterine pregnancy. findings were communicated to the on-call fellow dr. ___ at the time the study was performed. findings were subsequently discussed with surgical house officer, dr. ___, at the time of final interpretation.
evaluation of the ivc demonstrates flow within the infrarenal ivc. the extrahepatic portion of the ivc superior to the renal veins demonstrates appropriate directional flow for a segment of approximately 4-5 cm, although the vessel is quite attenuated along this length. no flow is seen within the intrahepatic portion of the ivc, for a length of approximately 6.5 cm up to the level where the hepatic veins empty into the ivc. this lack of ivc flow is apparent on multiple sequences. the short segment of ivc from the emptying of the hepatic veins to the right atrium appears widely patent. the left renal vein appears widely patent, emptying into the ivc. an extremely diminutive right-sided renal vein is also seen, thread-like in appearance. there is appropriate directional flow of the splenic and portal veins. the kidneys are extremely atrophic with multiple cysts, consistent with known history of dialysis and renal failure. limited evaluation of the remainder of abdominal structures is unremarkable. note is made of matted retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. evaluation of multiplanar reformatted images and volume-rendered images on an independent workstation supports these findings.
there has been interval development of multiple metastatic lesions throughout all lobes of the liver measuring up to 1.8 cm in size. there has been interval increase in size of the right renal mass, which infiltrates the entire right kidney, enlarges it, and extends beyond it into the adjacent perirenal fat, measuring 14.2 cm in craniocaudad extent. the collecting system is nearly entirely replaced by diffuse infiltrative tumor. tumor or clot within the collecting system extends down to the level of the right ureterovesicular junction. additionally, this tumor invades the right renal vein and extends superiorly into the infrahepatic ivc to approximately 2.5 cm below the junction of the right hepatic vein with the cava. there is no invasion into the hepatic veins or right atrium. additionally, there is direct invasion of tumor through the right renal venous wall into the surrounding perivenous fat. right paracolic gutter peritoneal metastasis measures 2.0 cm in short axis dimension. there are multiple enlarged pericaval and periaortic lymph nodes, the largest of which is best seen on series 3, image 8, measuring 2.3 cm in maximal width. there is no evidence for osseous metastatic disease. there is trace abdominal ascites. the remainder of the abdominal viscera, the left adrenal gland, pancreas, and spleen are unremarkable on this limited non-contrast evaluation. the left kidney is atrophic with a hydronephrotic collecting system.
the appendix is well seen in retrocecal location, contains negative intraluminal contrast and is of normal caliber. there are no periappendiceal inflammatory changes. there is moderate right-sided hydronephrosis and dilation of the right ureter proximal to its crossing with the iliac vessels. at the point of intersection of the ureter and iliac vessels, a small focus of low signal intensity, best seen on axial and reformatted fiesta images and coronal haste images, is consistent with an obstructing stone. there is a small amount of fluid surrounding the right kidney, likely related to perinephric edema or possibly due to forniceal rupture. there is mild pelvicaliectasis on the left, consistent with physiologic changes of pregnancy. the pancreas, imaged portions of the liver and gallbladder, and common bile duct appear normal. the ovaries appear normal bilaterally. a single intrauterine pregnancy is present. the placenta appears grossly unremarkable and the cervix measures 3.1 cm. the imaged marrow spaces appear within normal limits. multiplanar reformations were essential in delineating the above-described findings.
the liver is markedly irregular in contour and diffusely nodular, again consistent with cirrhosis. there are again numerous nodules with susceptibility artifact throughout the liver consistent with hemosiderin nodules. in addition to numerous punctate nodules showing susceptibility artifact, there is a diffuse appearance of signal loss on the gradient-echo images corresponding to t2* shortening which is consistent with diffuse iron deposition. a 4-mm focus of arterial enhancement within segment vii of the liver is unchanged since prior studies, and no new suspicious focal nodules are identified. the gallbladder is contracted and again demonstrates wall edema which is frequently seen in cirrhosis. gallstones mentioned previously are not identifiable. the pancreas demonstrates diffuse susceptbility-related signal loss, also consistent with iron deposition. the spleen is enlarged, and like the liver, shows numerous punctate foci of susceptibility artifact consistent with focal sites of hemosiderin deposition. however, the diffuse background signal intensity values of the spleen are fairly normal. signal intensity values of the visualized bone marrow are unremarkable. the major mesenteric arteries and veins appear patent. there is no portal vein thrombosis. numerous splenorenal collateral veins are again noted immediately inferomedial to the splenic hilum. there are multiple enlarged periportal and celiac lymph nodes, as noted on prior studies. a 22-mm diameter simple cyst is present in the upper pole of the left kidney, which is unchanged, but no suspicious renal lesions are identified. there is no ascites. multiplanar and subtraction images were performed on a separate dedicated workstation, aiding in evaluation of the findings.
the abdominal aorta is normal in caliber. the origins of the celiac artery and sma appear widely patent. there are two right renal arteries, and at least one left renal artery, which are also widely patent. there may be an accessory artery supplying the lower pole of the left kidney. the ___ is patent. there may be a slight area of narrowing just distal to the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery with mild post-stenotic dilatation. no filling defects are seen within main vessels and proximal branches. assessment of extremely distal vessels is limited due to small size. there are innumerable gallstones within the gallbladder. there is no free fluid in the abdomen. there is no overt bowel obstruction, hydronephrosis or abnormality in either adrenal gland. the liver and spleen are incompletely imaged. multiplanar 2d and 3d reformatted images were essential in evaluating the mesenteric vasculature.
the liver is enlarged, with a granular appearance, demonstrating diffusely decreased signal on t1 out-of-phase images when compared to in-phase images. these findings are consistent with fatty infiltration on a background of underlying liver disease. splenomegaly is also present. gallbladder appears unremarkable. allowing for the limitations in the patient's ability to perform breath-holds, the pancreas is probably normal as well. lymph nodes at the celiac axis/hepatic hilum measure up to approximately 13 mm in short axis. other shoddy retroperitoneal lymph nodes are also present, not meeting size criteria for pathologic enlargement. there is appropriate directional flow of the main portal vein as well as the ivc and the main hepatic veins. there is suggestion of esophageal varices, although imaging technique limits assessment. a small amount of ascites fluid as well as a small left-sided pleural effusion and associated atelectasis is seen.
the right kidney measures approximately 9.7 cm in length. a 4.2 x 3.7 cm solid mass is identified arising from the inferior pole. compared to the previous examination, there is increased signal on t2-weighted images and increased signal on t1-weighted images within the mass. the mass demonstrates both peripheral and central enhancements; only a small portion of the mass shows a lack of contrast enhancement. there is renal parenchymal thinning of the remainder of the right kidney and multiple cysts are identified. no renal vein invasion is identified. no enlarged lymph nodes are identified. note that the examination is somewhat limited by motion artifact. the left kidney measures approximately 9.4 cm in length. multiple cysts are identified within the renal parenchyma, which is thinned. a 1.4-1.5 cm left interpolar region renal mass is identified, again appears stable in size. cholecystectomy has been performed. the visualized portion of the liver appears unremarkable. mild left intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation is re- identified. subtraction and reformatted images were helpful in the above evaluation.
the kidneys measure approximately 9.6 and 9.7 cm in length, respectively, for the right and left kidneys. multiple simple renal cysts are scattered throughout both kidneys. within the inferior pole of the right kidney is a 4.3-cm mass with peripheral enhancement and low signal on t2-weighted images centrally which has increased in size (from 3.4 cm) from the ___ mri. central signal has decreased from prior mr examinations, likely due to hemorrhagic products. within the left kidney, in the lower pole, is a 1.4- to 1.5-cm mass with thick low signal rim (shown to be calcium on prior cts) and increased signal on t2-weighted images centrally. this is stable in size from the ___ ct examination. cholecystectomy has been performed. the common bile duct is dilated to approximately 1 cm. note is made of mild dilatation of the left intrahepatic bile ducts.
the abdominal aorta demonstrates normal course, caliber, and contour. the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries origins appear patent. there is symmetric enhancement of the kidneys, and the single renal arteries appear widely patent bilaterally.
the patient is status post liver transplant with marked enlargement of the splanchnic arterial and vascular systems. the main portal vein and its right and left branches are markedly enlarged. again seen is nonocclusive thrombus at the anastomotic site that accounts for approximately 20% of the lumen (series 14, image 38). the nonocclusive thrombus is seen extending minimally into the superior aspect of the splenic vein (series 14, image 55). finally, in the portosplenic confluence, where the smv drains into the splenic vein (series 14, image 39) there is nonocclusive thrombus which does not extend more distally into the smv. the clot burden is unchanged in comparison to the prior examination, which although it did not include the distal aspects of the smv, on axial haste images (series 4, image 4, ___), the crescentic shaped clot in the distal most aspect of the smv as it entered the splenic vein was seen and is unchanged. evaluation of the liver, adrenal glands, kidneys, pancreas is unremarkable. the spleen is markedly enlarged measuring 18.4 cm in maximal craniocaudad extent. multiple simple cysts are visualized in the kidneys bilaterally. there is no evidence for arterial thrombosis. no cavernous transformation is seen. visualized bowel is unremarkable. scattered mesenteric lymph nodes are seen. osseous structures are within normal limits. multiplanar 2d and 3d reformations as well as subtraction images were essential for demonstrating multiple perspectives on this dynamic series.
there are again numerous masses throughout the liver, most of which demonstrate heterogeneous enhancement patterns. the largest hepatic lesion, in the right hepatic lobe, is essentially unchanged in size, measuring up to 7.2 cm. several smaller masses demonstrate interval increase in size, including a mass in the posterior segment of the right hepatic lobe (sequence 2a image #8) that currently measures up to 1.7 cm and previously measured 1.4 cm and a mass in the lateral segment of the left hepatic lobe, measuring 1.6 cm (sequence 2 image #7), which previously measured 1.1 cm. there are confluent pancreatic masses, without significant interval change. there are multiple renal masses, also grossly unchanged. a large mass adjacent to the left kidney measuring 5.1 x 3.9 cm (sequence 2a image #11), is not appreciably changed in size. no evidence of hydronephrosis. the patient is again post-laminectomy. there is a stable small mass in the right adrenal gland. the left adrenal gland appears normal. blooming artifact from numerous retroperitoneal clips is again noted. there is a large filling defect in the left renal vein that extends across the midline and enters the ivc. the size of this thrombus has increased in the interval, however there appears to be flow around the thrombus. note is made of levoscoliosis of the thoracic spine. there are several, small hyperenhancing foci in the spine. an irregular non-enhancing lesion is in the right sacral bone, which was not imaged on the prior study.
the liver shows low signal on t2-weighted images, but otherwise appears unremarkable, without focal hepatic mass or intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation. the portal veins are widely patent. again, multiple gallstones are seen within the gallbladder. the common bile duct appears within normal limits. innumerable cysts are identified within the pancreas. some of the cysts within the pancreatic head appear to have enlarged from the previous examination, and some have nodular components. the cyst identified on the prior examination is slightly larger on the current examination. the adrenal glands appear unremarkable. the kidneys are atrophied, with multiple tiny bilateral cortical cysts, similar in appearance to the prior examination. there is no hydronephrosis. the spleen is diffusely low in signal on t2-weighted images, with the exception of a posterior area measuring approximately 4 cm in diameter, corresponding to a splenic hemangioma on the prior examination. the anterior- posterior dimension is large, at 19 cm. a tiny splenule is noted anterior to the spleen.
there is an atelectasis at the right lung base with a small amount of pleural effusions seen layering bilaterally. a small pericardial effusion is also appreciated. the liver and spleen demonstrate dark signal intensity on t2- weighted images, with possible susceptibility seen on increasing te weighted sequences, suggestive of mild hemosiderosis- note that this is incompletely evaluated on this limited examination. no definite hepatic lesions are seen. there is no evidence for abscess or mass within the liver. there is no intra- or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. limited evaluation of the adrenal glands, pancreas, kidneys is unremarkable. there is diffuse anasarca throughout the abdomen. no significant ascites or lymphadenopathy within the abdomen.
the portal venous system is markedly dilated; the left main portal branch measures approximately 22 mm in diameter, and the right approximately 36 mm (which was 31 mm in ___). the splenic vein measures upto 27 mm in diameter. the superior mesenteric vein is not included on this examination. at the portal vein-splenic vein confluence is an eccentric nonenhancing thrombus measuring 4 cm in length with substantially less than 50% occlusion; this was not present on the previous examination. on t2- weighted images, some increased signal is identified within the thrombus. again identified within the right hepatic lobe is a portal venous varix with portal-hepatic venous shunt. thrombus within it on prior has resolved. the celiac, superior mesenteric, and splenic arteries are markedly enlarged. multiple enlarged lymph nodes are identified (retrocaval, periportal, pericaval). the spleen is markedly enlarged (21 cm anteriorposterior extent 22 cm in craniocaudal extent). extensive splenic varices are present. bilateral renal cysts are identified. note that the kidneys are only partially visualized on the contrast-enhanced portion of this examination. note is made of left hydronephrosis to the upj level, and a left extrarenal pelvis. corticomedullary differentiation is maintained, with slight cortical thinning, more than on the previous (___) examination. the adrenal glands appear unremarkable. subtraction and reformatted images were helpful to the above evaluation.
there is a small amount of ascites surrounding the liver. there has been continued mild interval increase in patient's splenomegaly with the spleen currently measuring approximately 17.9 cm in longest dimension. there has been interval progression of disease. there is cavernous transformation of the main portal vein (complete occlusion of the main portal vein) and thrombosis of the right and left intrahepatic veins. more inferiorly, the imv is completely occluded. the remainder of the vascular structures in the liver and abdomen are widely patent. more specifically: the hepatic veins, hepatic arteries, splenic vein and smv are widely patent. the aorta and ivc are widely patent. the adrenal glands and kidneys are unremarkable except for a simple right renal cyst. the pancreas is unremarkable. there is mild lymphadenopathy within the abdomen. the abdominal aorta is of normal caliber. there is no osseous disease. multiplanar 2d and 3d reformations as well as subtraction images were essential in demonstrating multiple perspectives for this dynamic series.
in segment viii of the right hepatic lobe, there is a vague, poorly defined, enhancing focus, only seen on the arterial phase (sequence 12 image #336). this most likely represents a perfusional abnormality, although given patient's history of hcc, cannot entirely exclude neoplasm. the remaining enhancing foci identified on the prior mr are not visualized on today's study. notably, the previously seen ring- enhancing lesion in segment vii of the right hepatic lobe is not present on today's study. no new or suspicious hepatic lesions are identified in this patient status post hepatic transplant. there is a small, 1.0 x 0.6 cm cyst at the inferior margin of the right hepatic lobe (sequence 16, image #673). there is again moderate focal stenosis of the portal vein, which is essentially unchanged. no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation. there are two, very small cysts in the pancreatic head, which are stable. otherwise, the pancreas is unremarkable. the spleen contains numerous gamna- gandy bodies, consistent with history of portal hypertension. there is a subdiaphragmatic structure that is low signal on t2, which was present on prior study, that may represent post-procedural fibrosis. the adrenal glands, kidneys are normal. the visualized bowel is unremarkable. there is a small amount of perisplenic free fluid. no pathologically enlarged abdominal or retroperitoneal lymph nodes. multiplanar 2d and 3d reformations as well as subtraction images were essential in demonstrating multiple perspectives for this dynamic series.

the liver again demonstrates diffuse macronodular appearance, with multiple nodules which demonstrate slightly increased t2 signal intensity and heterogeneous enhancement pattern (including some briskly enhancing during the arterial phase), which is similar in configuration in comparison to the prior study. several of these appear more conspicuous on arterial enhancing images; however, this is likely related to differences in technique in comparison to prior study, rather than any significant interval change in pathology. the portal and hepatic veins are patent. the gallbladder is stable in appearance. the pancreas, adrenal glands, and right kidney are normal in appearance. a simple cyst is seen in the left kidney which is stable. the patient is status post splenectomy. the bowel is normal in appearance. again seen are prominent retroperitoneal and periportal lymph nodes, measuring up to 20 mm in short axis diameter in the periportal region, which are stable in configuration in comparison to prior exam. the osseous structures are stable in appearance. multiplanar 2d and 3d reformations were essential in evaluating the dynamic series.

no prior imaging is available for comparison. within the rectus muscles on the right side in the region of the right upper quadrant, well seen on image #22 of series 4, there is a focal fluid collection measuring 14 mm anteroposterior x 29 mm transverse x 21 mm craniocaudal. this fluid collection does demonstrate peripheral enhancement. no significant inflammation is seen in the surrounding fat. post- traumatic hematoma is thought to be most likely. recommend clinical correlation. given the patient's clinical history of diabetes, other considerations do include focal infection, and therefore, ultrasound with possible aspiration could be performed as clinically dictated. this finding is discussed with the triage nurse, ___, at the ___ medical clinics. the adrenal glands, kidneys, pancreas, spleen, and gallbladder appear grossly unremarkable. diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver with areas of focal sparing about the gallbladder fossa are incidentally noted. the visualized bowel appears grossly unremarkable. no suspicious bony lesions are identified. multiplanar 2d and 3d reformations and subtraction images were generated on an independent workstation.

comparison with mri exams of ___, ___ and ___, and fdg pet ct ___.
direct comparison is made to a recent ct scan dated ___. two heterogeneously enhancing left renal masses are identified. the larger mass lesion extends exophytically from the lower pole of the left kidney and measures 12.8 in the anteroposterior by 12.1 in the craniocaudal x 15.5 cm in transverse dimension. this mass lesion does appear to arise from the renal parenchyma, specifically, the medial aspect of the inferior pole as well as the inferior most aspect of the inferior pole renal parenchyma. this mass lesion is noted to abut and likely invade the adjacent gerota's fascia. the second, smaller lesion measures 7.2 in the anteroposterior x 5.7 in the transverse x 5.4 cm in the craniocaudal dimension. this lesion is located within the medial aspect of the upper pole of the left kidney. imaging characteristics are consistent with renal cell carcinoma. significant degree of necrosis is identified within these lesions, predominantly the larger lesion. there appears to be a single left renal artery. the left renal vein is patent. the left adrenal gland appears unremarkable. the right adrenal gland and kidney are surgically absent. on the current examination, some of the left kidney is significantly decompressed when compared to the aforementioned ct scan. no significant retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is identified. no suspicious bony lesions are seen. visualized portions of the liver, spleen, and pancreas appear grossly unremarkable. the visualized bowel appears grossly unremarkable. multiplanar 2d and 3d reformations provided multiple perspectives for the dynamic series.
study is severely limited by patient body habitus and motion. there is a cirrhotic liver morphology. two dominant arterially enhancing lesions are again noted in the right lobe: one more superiorly located (series 100, image 33) measuring approximately 12 x 13 mm, and one slightly more inferiorly located measuring 15 x 11 mm (series 100, image 43) that correspond to the arterially enhancing lesion seen on the ct scan of ___. both of these lesions are isointense on portal venous and delayed images. subtle washout was more conspicuous on the previous ct examination. additionally, a 5-mm arterially enhancing nodule is seen at the dome of the liver peripherally (series 100, image 32) that is more conspicuous on today's examination. there are numerous background tiny nodules that presumably represent regenerative nodules. the two dominant arterially enhancing lesions in the liver are difficult to appreciate on the t1- and t2-weighted images which are markedly technically limited. there is a small cyst in the right lobe of the liver (series 300, image 39). the portal vein is patent. the hepatic veins appear patent. there is a replaced right hepatic artery originating from the sma. there is splenomegaly. left adrenal nodule is unchanged and indeterminate, and cannot be assessed on the in- and out-of- phase t1- weighted images. the right adrenal gland and kidneys are unremarkable. there is mild/moderate ascites and a large right pleural effusion with associated compressive atelectasis.
there is an ill-defined, t2-bright 1.9 cm mass lesion in the inferior aspect of the right hepatic lobe, which enhances peripherally, but not centrally. there is a large amount of surrounding parenchymal hyperemia on early arterial imaging and a small amount of adjacent perihepatic fluid. this corresponds to the hypodensity seen on recent ct examination. the visualized bowel maintains a normal appearance without area of inflammation to suggest a potential source of seeding. there has additionally been enlargement of bilateral pleural effusions, right more so than left, with adjacent airspace disease, atelectasis versus pneumonia. gallbladder is distended; however, no biliary dilatation is seen. pancreas and adrenal glands maintain a normal appearance. spleen and kidneys enhance as expected. no abnormal lymphadenopathy is seen. no additional hepatic lesions.
again demonstrated within the peripheral posteromedial interpolar region of the left kidney is a slightly exophytic, 14 x 14 x 12 mm, well-circumscribed, lobulated, round lesion unchanged in size and appearance from the previous mr. this lesion remains isointense with respect to the renal parenchyma on t1- weighted images, and slightly hypointense on t2-weighted images. low-grade homogeneous internal enhancement is again identified within this lesion. the remainder of the left kidney is unremarkable. the right kidney contains several subcentimeter simple cysts, unchanged. no new mass lesions or areas of abnormal enhancement are present. there is no hydronephrosis. corticomedullary differentiation is preserved bilaterally. single renal arteries and veins are seen bilaterally and are widely patent. diffuse dropout in signal within the liver and spleen on the longer echo time, t1 out-of-phase images compared to the in-phase images is consistent with hemosiderosis. the pancreas and bone marrow appears to be uninvolved. no focal hepatic or splenic lesions are otherwise demonstrated. no intra- or extra- hepatic biliary duct dilatation is present. the gallbladder and adrenal glands are within normal limits. pancreas divisum is again demonstrated. 6-mm homogeneously hyperintense round lesion on t2-weighted images within the head of the pancreas is a consistent with a cyst. no internal enhancement or nodularity is seen within this cyst, and this cyst is unchanged from the recent ct or mr. ___ new pancreatic lesions otherwise are present. main pancreatic duct is normal in caliber and smooth in contour. the pancreatic parenchyma is otherwise within normal limits. abdominal aorta is normal in caliber. there is no free fluid. no pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes are present. multiple bony abnormalities are identified: (1) hypointense signal on t2- weighted images involving the superior aspect of the l2 vertebral body with associated enhancement is most suggestive of a compression fracture, new from ___. (2) ill- defined hypointense signal on t2-weighted images involving the right sacrum with abnormal enhancement is of uncertain etiology. possible linear areas of low signal on t2-weighted images are seen within this area of abnormal signal in the sacrum, raising the possibility of insufficiency fracture. however, the possibility of an associated bony lesin in the right sacral ala cannot be excluded. (3) there is a 13-mm focal round lesion within the right anterior superior iliac ___ which is homogeneously hypointense on t2- weighted images homogeneously enhances and is not significantly changed from the previous examination. this lesion corresponds to a sclerotic lesion seen on prior ct from ___. there is at least a second similar appearing, smaller lesion is also noted in the right iliac ___ inferiorly. there is diffuse marrow heterogeneity, that presumably reflects the patient's history of aml with bone marrow transplant. multiplanar 2d and 3d reformations were essential in providing multiple perspectives for the dynamic series.
no focal liver lesions are identified. the gallbladder is normal. there is no biliary ductal dilatation. the pancreas is atrophic. there are multiple small periportal and peripancreatic lymph nodes. adrenal glands are normal. there are several small simple renal cysts. the patient is status post gastric pull-through, status post esophagectomy. the reformatted images provided multiple perspectives for the dynamic series.
direct comparison is made to prior examination dated ___. the patient is status post liver transplant. evaluation of the liver parenchyma does reveal multiple small hyperattenuating foci seen only on the arterial phase of postcontrast imaging. no abnormalities are seen on the various other sequences, including the pre-contrast imaging. therefore, these small arterially enhancing lesions likely represent vascular shunts and benign perfusion abnormalities. attention to these areas should be paid on followup examinations. several of these lesions are well seen, for example on images 9, 30, 31, and 33 of series #8. since prior mri dated ___ and ct dated ___, the patient's native common bile duct does appear to have increased slightly in maximal diameter measuring up to approximately 22 mm. there remains no evidence of intrahepatic biliary dilatation. the patient's posttransplant hepatic arterial and portal venous anatomy is as expected and remains unremarkable. small left upper quadrant hematoma is again identified which measures up to approximately 14 x 10 mm on the current study. significant susceptibility artifact is noted especially about the metallic object in the patient's stomach. note, this does impact degree of visualization of the lateral aspect of the left lobe of the liver. a simple-appearing renal cysts are identified bilaterally. the adrenal glands and pancreas are unremarkable. visualized portions of the bowel appear grossly unremarkable. no suspicious bony lesions are identified.
the liver is shrunken in size and demonstrates a nodular contour, findings compatible with cirrhosis. recanalized umbilical vein is again demonstrated. within segment vi/vii, a large mass measuring 6.9 (cc) x 4.5 (tv) x 5.7 (ap) cm is heterogeneously hypointense on t1-weighted images and mildly hyperintense on t2-weighted images. after the administration of contrast, heterogeneous enhancement is seen within the mass with a central area of hypoenhancement suggestive of necrosis. enhancing filling defects within the branches of the right posterior portal vein are consistent with tumor thrombus. findings are most suggestive of hepatocellular carcinoma. additionally, scattered throughout the liver are several, predominantly subcentimeter arterially enhancing lesions which do not demonstrate washout on the delayed phases of imaging post- contrast. these arterially enhancing foci are isointense on t1- and t2- weighted images with respect to the liver parenchyma and are nonspecific findings, possibly representing arteriovenous shunts. the largest of these lesions is located within segment v of the liver and measures 1.5 x 1.8 cm. hepatic arteries and hepatic veins are patent. no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation is present. 3.8 x 1.9 cm gallstone is seen within the gallbladder which otherwise appears unremarkable. spleen is enlarged measuring 14 cm in greatest craniocaudal dimension without focal lesions. the adrenal glands and visualized bowel loops are within normal limits. several hyperintense round lesions within both kidneys on t2-weighted images are consistent with simple cysts, not markedly changed in the interval. a cyst with few thin internal septations is also seen within the upper pole of the right kidney measuring 14 mm, but does not demonstrate any suspicious features. corticomedullary differentiation is preserved. there is no hydronephrosis. the abdominal aorta is normal in caliber. several enlarged periportal lymph nodes are identified likely due to the patient's underlying chronic liver disease. there is no ascites. bone marrow signal is within normal limits. multiplanar 2d and 3d reformations were essential in providing multiple perspectives for the dynamic series.
a 5.1 x 8.1 x 5.4 cm mass is identified within the interpolar/lower pole of the right kidney which extensively infiltrates the renal sinus. this mass is markedly heterogeneous on both t1- and t2-weighted images, without definite evidence of signal dropout on the out-of-phase t1-weighted images compared to in-phase images to suggest the presence of microscopic fat. avid heterogeneous enhancement, particularly during the arterial phase, is seen within predominantly the periphery of this mass with a central area of non-enhancement compatible with necrosis. several small capsular collateral vessels supply this mass. three right renal arteries are seen as well as two right renal veins, all of which are widely patent. the collecting system is likely involved by tumor, but is not well evaluated on these images. a well-defined cylindrical filling defect within the proximal right ureter is identified (series 16, images 41-62) and perhaps may represent concentrated gadolinium, and less likely represents a stent. several scattered simple renal cortical cysts are demonstrated bilaterally with the largest in the upper pole of the left kidney measuring 4.6 cm. left kidney otherwise is unremarkable. single left renal artery and renal vein are demonstrated and are widely patent. there is no hydronephrosis identified bilaterally. 6.1 x 5.2 x 7.1 cm heterogeneous mass arising from the left adrenal gland demonstrates heterogeneous enhancement after contrast administration. the right adrenal gland is normal. in the visualized portion of the liver, a few nonenhancing hyperintense lesions on t2-weighted images are consistent with simple hepatic cysts. a lobulated 13 mm lesion within segment 6 of the liver appears to fill in centrally with contrast on delayed post-contrast images, suggesting a hemangioma. no intra- or extra- hepatic biliary duct dilatation is identified. the spleen is unremarkable. several subcentimeter hyperintense foci on t2- weighted images are identified within the neck of the pancreas likely representing benign cysts. remainder of the pancreas appears unremarkable. the pancreatic duct is normal in caliber and smooth in contour. the gallbladder and visualized bowel loops are within normal limits. within the right adnexa, a 2 cm homogeneously hyperintense, round, well- circumscribed, thin-walled lesion does not demonstrate any internal enhancement, compatible with a cyst. visualized aspect of the uterus is unremarkable. within the descending aorta, a large penetrating ulcer is identified measuring 2.3 x 1.9 cm, with the neck of the ulcer measuring approximately 8 mm wide. large amount of surrounding mild hyperintensity on t1-weighted images is consistent with thrombus or involuting intramural hematoma. the remainder of the abdominal aorta is normal in caliber but demonstrates mural irregularity consistent with atherosclerotic plaque. no pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes are present. there is no free fluid. within the t11, t12, and l1 vertebral bodies, abnormal enhancement and signal changes on t2-weighted images suggest degenerative disc disease. no focal bone marrow lesions suggestive of metastases are identified. the patient is status post left hip replacement. multiplanar 2d and 3d reformations were essential in providing multiple perspectives for the dynamic series.
