1. no ct evidence of pulmonary embolism. 2. interval increase in size and number of mediastinal lymphadenopathy. stable right pericardial lymphadenopathy. 3. linear atelectasis within the right lower lobe with adjacent 7 mm nodular density in the right lung base, which may represent a new nodule versus focal area of atelectasis.
1. no obvious explanation for pericardial effusion. pericarditis due to infection or myocardial infarction (dressler's syndrome) is most likely. 2. small residual pericardial effusion with pericardial drain in place, right greater than left pleural effusions. 3. subcarinal lymphadenopathy, likely reactive. 4. atherosclerotic coronary artery calcifications. minimal aortic valvular calcification. 5 . mild paraseptal emphysema.
1. findings of mild small bowel dilatation compatible with post-operative ileus. however, early or partial bowel obstruction due to adhesion or metastasis cannot be excluded. no free air. if there is clinical concern for obstruction, follow-up with radiographs may be helpful to monitor forward progress of contrast. 2. status post loop colostomy and sigmoid stent revision with relief of pre-existing colonic obstruction. irregular thickening of the ascending colon could be due to postoperative edema, but infection or inflammation cannot be excluded. please correlate clinically. there is also still fluid and minimal prominence in caliber of the descending colon beyond the loop colostomy site. 3. increased pulmonary metastases. stable hepatic metastases. overall increased diffuse mediastinal, retroperitoneal, mesenteric, inguinal and iliac lymphadenopathy. 4. no findings suggestive of pneumonia. 5. unusual orientation of the gallbladder fundus, which has reflected lateral to the liver. however, given the lack of distension or wall thickening, torsion seems unlikely. however, if there are specific clinical concerns referring to the area, follow-up with son___ could be considered.
1. the study is extremely limited study in evaluation of pulmonary embolism due to the phase of the scan. if pulmonary embolism is still high in the differential, a repeat cta should be considered. 2. no acute intrathoracic process. 3. small hiatal hernia.
1. right hilar mass with extension into mediastinum and with lymphangitic carcinomatosis in rll and rml, consistent with reported history of rll small cell carcinoma. 2. bronchoceles in the rll with wall thickening and containing debris and fluid are consistent with necrotizing bronchiectasis; if the patient has not had radiation therapy, infectious cause would be most suspect. patchy peripheral opacities likely representing infection from aspirated fluid/debris from bronchoceles. 3. right hilar mass causes narrowing of arteries and bronchi, and amputates the right pulmonary vein. no pulmonary embolism seen. findings were initially posted on the ed dashboard upon completion of the study.
1. porta hepatis mass, demonstrating hypoenhancement on the arterial phase, with persistent enhancement on the 15-minute delayed sequences, compatible with cholangiocarcinoma. overall, the examination is not significantly changed since ___. increased areas of areterial hypoenhancement may represent chemoradiation-related changes. 2. increased moderate intra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation. 3. two appropriately positioned biliary drains.
1. decreasing left upper lobe cavitary consolidation and improving marked peribronchial thickening of the left upper lobe bronchus. these findings may be due to an improving postobstructive cavitary pneumonia. cavitation arising within an area of radiation pneumonitis is less likely. 2. slight increase in size of left pleural effusion. 3. stable ct appearance of two small right lung nodules and a small indeterminate left adrenal gland lesion.
1. intraluminal left atrial mass with features consistent with given history of atrial myxoma. 2. mildly enlarged mediastinal and cardiophrenic lymph nodes. these are nonspecific, and may be reactive. attention to these areas is recommended. 3. bilateral pleural effusions. 4. multiple tiny nodules, one of which is calcified. these are indeterminate and follow up after treatment is recommended to confirm stability. 5. left adrenal mass. further evaluation with mri is recommended.
1. generalized anasarca. 2. large bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. compressive atelectasis. no evidence of pulmonary embolism or thoracic aortic dissection. 3. large ventral wall hernia containing small and large bowel without evidence of bowel obstruction or strangulation. 4. left renal cyst. 5. multiple low density lesions in the pancreas, most likely sidebranch ipmn and/or possibly old pseudocysts. further evaluation with mrcp or pancreas ct is recommended if the patient;s condition improves. a wet read was placed by dr. ___ ___ at 1 a.m. on ___.
1. new foci of tumor in the left hilum, posterior mediastinum, right lung. new right pleural effusion causing compressive atelectasis of the right middle and lower lobes. 2. bronchial wall thickeing, scattered ground glass and peripheral tree-in- ___ opacities in the left lung can represent active areas of infection/inflammation. respiratory artifact complicates fine assessment of the lung bases. lymphangetic spread of disease is not excluded.
stable examination, right axillary postoperative seroma slightly decreased in size. no evidence for metastatic disease. liver cysts and left renal cysts are stable.
1. status post right middle lobectomy. stable right upper lobe lung nodule. 2. new left lower lobe 3 mm lung nodule. attention on followup. 3. left adrenal nodule has decreased in size since the most recent prior study and varied in size since ___. this is most consistent with metastatic deposit rather than an adenoma. 4. coronary artery calcifications.
1. no evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection. ectatic ascending aorta measuring 4 cm at the level of the main pulmonary artery. 2. obstructing 4 x 6 mm right upj stone with subsequent moderate right-sided hydronephrosis and a small amount of perinephric fluid which may be attributed to a ruptured calix. 3. left atrial enlargement and thickened mitral valve which may represent mitral valve stenosis. correlation with cardiac echo is recommended. 4. questionable 6mm patchy opacity / nodule is noted in the right middle lung fields on image 82 . a follow up ct may be performed in ___ months to asses interval change and to assess stability. please compare with the prior studies for interval change if available.
1. marked interval increase in size of large bilateral pleural effusions with loculated components. 2. persistent multifocal ground-glass opacities within the lungs. followup imaging after treatment recommended to document resolution. 3. incompletely imaged left supraclavicular region, where fluid collection and subcutaneous emphysema are again seen. please see dictation for clip #___ (dedicated neck ct) for further evaluation of this region. findings were discussed with dr. ___ ___ at 7:30 p.m., ___.

1. no evidence of pe. 2. bilateral ground-glass opacities involving all lobes. in combination with right hilar lymphadenopathy this is concerning for atypical pneumonia. differential diagnosis includes asymmetric pulmonary edema, aspiration, or ards.
1. no evidence of pulmonary embolism. 2. 1.6 x 1.3 cm spiculated mass in the posterior aspect of the left upper lobe, concerning for malignancy. 3. left hilar, mediastinal, and peritracheal lymphadenopathy. 4. bilateral emphysematous changes with ground-glass opacities most prominent in bilateral upper lobes. 5. right-sided pleural effusion.
1. severe progression of widespread pneumonia, now accompanied by the small layering non-hemorrhagic pleural effusion. there is no direct radiographic evidence that this represents empyema, but if the fluid volume continues to increase, sampling is recommended to distinguish pleural infection from reactive exudate. 2. although mild-to-moderate central adenopathy has been relatively stable (with the exception of enlarging right hilar node), moderate splenomegaly has progressed substantially. diagnostic considerations of advancing multifocal consolidationi include legionnaires disease and similar infections. dr. ___ and i discussed the findings and their clinical significance over the telephone at the time of dictation.
1. no evidence of pulmonary embolism. 2. a significant interval worsening and development of new areas of airspace opacities in the both lung fields, that likely represent multi-focal infection, however given increase in size of mediastinal lymph nodes, progression of malignancy remains a possibility. differential diagnosis also includes interstitial edema. 3. unchanged appearance of small left pleural effusion, and pericardial effusion, and slight decrease in the size of the right pleural effusion. 4. status post thoracotomy and right upper lobe resection with reconstruction of svc, with stable appearance of postoperative changes.
1. progression of metastatic disease, with increased lymphadenopathy and interval enlargement of the left pulmonary nodule. 2. complete obstruction of the right mainstem bronchus. near complete collapse and consolidation of the right lung. 3. small loculated right pleural effusion. 4. minor narrowing of the proximal left main stem bronchus.
1. left hilar mass invading the right main bronchus just proximal to the upper lobe orifice, surrounds and invades the left lower lobe and lingular bronchi and surrounds the mid left descending pulmonary artery, extending medially along the left superior pulmonary vein. no evidence of mediastinal invasion. 2. new 4-mm upper lobe nodule is suspicious for metastasis.
1. enlarged heterogeneous uterus, likely reflecting tab one day prior. however, there is a large amount of heterogeneous fluid and debris within the endometrial canal. this may reflect hematometra, though retained products of conception cannot be excluded by ct and ultrasound is recommended for further evaluation. superinfection also cannot be excluded by ct imaging, and clinical correlation is advised. 2. no free fluid or free air in the abdomen or pelvis to suggest uterine perforation. 3. no evidence of pulmonary embolus within the limits of this study, which is limited by suboptimal bolus timing. 4. heterogeneous enhancement of the kidneys may reflect phase of contrast timing, though correlation with urinalysis is recommended to exclude pyelonephritis.
1. cardiomegaly. 2. l1 anterior wedge deformity, 50% loss of height, of uncertain chronicity. correlate with point tenderness.
1. mass in the right upper lobe, suspicious for new primary lung cancer. the mass abuts the minor fissure and there is questionable extension into the right middle lobe periperally. a resolving focus of pneumonia is considered much less likely than neoplasm given this finding and the presence of apparent skeletal mets. 2. interstitial lung disease may be nsip, unlikely due to lymphangitic spread. 3. right paratracheal and right hilar adenopathy. 4. osteolytic lesions in the thoracic spine and in right scapula suspicious for metastases. 5. 9-mm hypodense lesion in the liver. given that this is new, an ultrasound should be performed for further characterization.

1. no evidence of pulmonary embolus. 2. no evidence of aortic dissection. 3. slightly more prominent/enlarged appearances of multiple pulmonary abscesses, although the large air-containing one appears slightly smaller than before.
1) slight interval decrease in the appearance of bilateral patchy lung opacities. 2) new bowel wall thickening in a long segment of small bowel with associated small to moderate amount of ascites. this appearance is most suggestive of graft versus host disease, less likely infectious enteritis or vasculitis. findings discussed with dr. ___ at the time of the study.
1. new pulmonary edema. 2. new bilateral pleural effusions (right greater than left). 3. mediastinal lymphadenopathy, unchanged. 4. multiple non-calcified pulmonary nodules which appear stable over 15 months, measuring up to 6 mm, likely representing granulomas or myeloid metasplasic pulmonary involvement. sesha

1. no concerning thoracic lesions. 2. sigmoid diverticulosis with no evidence of acute diverticulitis. 3. iud in situ. 4. no evidence of abdominal or pelvic malignancy.
1) no pulmonary embolism. 2) left basilar parenchymal opacity, which may represent pneumonia vs. aspiration. this could also be an area of focal atelectasis. 3) central faint ground-glass opacities and vascular redistribution suggestive of congestive heart failure. less likely, this could represent hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
1. large right hemothorax with a linear focus of enhancement in the right pleural space anteriorly, at the site of previously seen active extravasation. this likely reflects continued active bleeding, likely from an intercostal vessel. 2. associated near complete collapse of the right lung, though the right lung apex is better aerated. 3. new small left pleural effusion and multifocal linear atelectasis within the left lung. findings were discussed with ___ ___ at approximately 4 p.m.
1. bilateral pulmonary nodules are stable to decreased in size. probable stability of centrilobular nodular opacities within the left upper ___. 2. large extraluminal gas collection extending from right lateral aspect of the rectum to base of the penis and scrotum. findings are consistent with perirectal abscess or other gas producing infectious process. 3. multiple punctate calcifications in the liver and spleen consistent with prior granulomatous infection. calcified and atrophic left kidney is suggestive of prior tuberculous infection. 4. stable hypodense lesions in the right kidney and within the left ___ of the liver and caudate ___ of the liver, too small to accurately characterize. 5. bilateral bowel-containing inguinal hernias without evidence of bowel obstruction. the findings were discussed with dr. ___ ___ at the time of image interpretation (4:28 p.m.).
