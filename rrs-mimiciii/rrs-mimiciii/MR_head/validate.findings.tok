patient is status post left frontotemporoparietal craniotomy. there has been interval decrease in post-surgical changes as demonstrated by decrease in size of left subdural frontotemporoparietal fluid collection and resolution of pneumocephalus. there is still persistent left subdural fluid collection. there is a persistent small amount of fluid within the left temporal calvarium which does not demonstrate restricted diffusion or ring enhancement to suggest abscess. there has been interval decrease in susceptibility within the resection cavity consistent with decrease in hemorrhage. there is a punctate focus of intrinsic t1 hyperintensity, which may represent persistent small amount of hemorrhage or calcification. there has been interval increase in irregular thick nodular enhancement within the left temporal lobe extending up into the insular region. two satellite ring-enhancing lesions are noted within the left frontal inferior gyrus. there has been interval increase in ependymal extension into the occipital and temporal ___ of the left lateral ventricle. there is restricted diffusion corresponding to some areas of ring enhancement predominantly in the posterior aspect of the ring enhancement consistent with high-grade tumor. there has been interval increase in flair signal abnormality surrounding the lesion. there has been interval increase in extent and thickening of left frontoparietal and temporal pachymeningeal enhancement. this may represent post-surgical change rather tumor seeding of the pachymeninges. there is mucosal thickening in the bilateral maxillary antra as well as some aerosolized secretions on the right. there is mucosal thickening of the bilateral ethmoid air cells as well as complete opacification. there is a mucosal retention cyst in the left sphenoid sinus. the bilateral sphenoid sinuses demonstrate mucosal thickening. there is fluid within the left mastoid air cells.
no significant interval change was seen since the previous study. subtle increased signal in the temporal lobes bilaterally is noted. no abnormal enhancement is seen. there is no evidence of midline shift, mass effect, or hydrocephalus. there is no evidence of abnormal parenchymal, vascular, or meningeal enhancement seen. there is no evidence of acute infarct.
there are new areas of slow diffusion in left frontal and parietal lobes involving the precentral gyrus suggestive of acute infarcts. areas of slow diffusion are noted in left corona radiata, left thalamus, left parieto-occipital regions and splenium of corpus callosum which are unchanged since the prior study. areas of gliosis with flair and t2 hyperintensities are noted in bilateral occipital lobes which are sequelae of subacute/ chronic infarcts (left greater than right). there is no evidence of hemorrhagic transformation of infarcts. there is prominence of the cortical sulci, ventricular system and extra-axial csf spaces suggestive of generalized cerebral atrophy. mucosal thickening is noted in the sphenoid sinus and bilateral ethmoid air cells. orbits are unremarkable. there is partial opacification of bilateral mastoid air cells.
the study is somewhat technically limited. within the limitations of the examination, the previously noted right frontal abscess appears to have decreased considerably in size as well as surrounding edema. the abscess cavity appears to have collapsed almost completely. the enhancement in the right thalamus noted on the prior study along the tract of the dbs has resolved. overall extent of enhancing abnormality has decreased from 17 mm to 10 mm in greatest dimension. left dbs lead is again noted terminating in the region of the thalamus. the ventricles and sulci are stable. no hydrocephalus is seen.
there is no evidence for edema, mass effect, acute or chronic infarction, or blood products in the brain. the ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration. a punctate focus of t2 hyperintensity in the anterior left temporal subcortical white matter (5:13) is nonspecific. t1-hyperintensity of the pituitary, without enlargement or a fluid level, may indicate either mild hemorrhage or a small lesion, such as an adenoma. there is no obvious expansion of the cavernous sinuses and no obvious lesions in the basal cisterns. evaluation of the cranial nerves is otherwise limited in the absence of intravenous contrast. fluid in the mastoid air cells and right sphenoid sinuses is likely secondary to intubated status.
there is marked thinning of the corpus callosum at the isthmus with associated atrophy of the decrease in volume of the mammillary bodies as well as superior vermis. there is also bifrontal volume loss with associated prominence of the sulci. there are non- specific foci of t2/flair hyperintensity involving the bilateral centrum semiovale and periventricular regions, likely representing chronic microangiopathic small vessel ischemic changes in a patient of this age. there is no evidence for acute infarct. there is no evidence for intra-axial or extra-axial hemorrhage. no hydrocephalus is identified. the major vascular flow voids are unremarkable. incidental note is made of bilateral lens implants. there is a mucosal retention cyst in the right maxillary antrum. otherwise, the remainder of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
there is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, territorial infarct or space-occupying lesion. the ventricles, extra-axial csf spaces and cortical sulci appear normal. brain-stem and cerebellum appear normal. there is no abnormal leptomeningeal or parenchymal enhancement. the bones of the skull and of the visualized cervical vertebrae show heterogenously hypointense marrow signal on t1-weighted images, which likely represents diffuse marrow infiltration by multiple myeloma. the orbits are unremarkable. the visualized paranasal sinuses are clear. t2 hyperintense signal is noted in bilateral mastoid air cells suggestive of mucosal thickening/fluid.
no new intracranial masses or abnormal foci of enhancement are identified. the right cerebellar metastasis is stable in size at 1.5 cm ap x 1.4 cm tv x 1.2 cm si. this demonstrates heterogeneous contrast enhancement and internal susceptibility, consistent with mineralization or hemorrhage. there is continued surrounding vasogenic edema, without fourth ventricular effacement or midline shift. focal nodular enhancement in the right occipital lobe (10:39) has enlarged to 5 mm, previously 3 mm. this is peripherally located, either in the cortex or the subarachnoid space. there is no significant diffusion restriction or surrounding edema. a 1-mm faint focus of enhancement in the left postcentral gyrus is essentially unchanged. the ventricles and sulci are prominent, consistent with age- and radiation-related changes. scattered nonspecific foci of t2/___ periventricular and subcortical hyperintensity may reflect microvascular and/or radiation-related changes. major intracranial vascular flow voids are intact. mild mucosal thickening is noted in the bilateral maxillary sinuses and multiple ethmoid air cells. the mastoid air cells are clear. orbits and intraconal structures are preserved. again noted is a 7 mm well-defined, ovoid lesion in the right parietal calvarium (10:73), with mild contrast enhancement. given the well-circumscribed borders and stability since ___, this favors a nonaggressive entity such as arachnoid granulation, venous ___, or intraosseous hemangioma. the craniocervical junction is normally located. upper cervical spine alignment is preserved.
the study is compared with the recent nect of ___. allowing for the patient's age, there is generalized atrophy, with proportionate prominence of the cortical sulci and fissures and the ventricles and cisterns. the flair sequences are otherwise unremarkable, with no focal signal abnormality to specifically suggest gliosis related to the given history of past tbi. similarly, there is no "blooming" susceptibility artifact to suggest either chronic or acute intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage. though there is symmetric prominence of the lateral ventricular temporal horns and their uncal recesses, bilaterally, this appears proportionate to the global atrophy, rather than selective medial temporal atrophy. however, there is some loss of the normal striated architecture of the hippocampal formations, bilaterally. there is no specific forniceal or mamillary body atrophy. there is no focus of restricted diffusion and the principal intracranial vascular flow-voids, including those of the dural venous sinuses, are preserved, and these structures enhance normally. there is no pathologic focus of parenchymal, leptomeningeal or dural enhancement. the sella, parasellar region and remainder of the skull base, orbits and paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are unremarkable.
as before there is a 2.5cm cystic lesion located in the region of the vermis which is not signficantly changed from the prior study. no enhancing nodule is seen. no pathologically enhancing lesions are seen. the ventricles are symmetric and are not dilated. incidental note is made of a deep medullary vein adjacent to the right lateral ventricle as well as a developmental venous anomaly in the region of the medial temporal lobe.
a non-enhancing lesion is identified at the right temporal lobe with high signal intensity on t2 and flair sequences (4:10), with mild low 0000signal intensity on t1, measuring approximately 13.6 x 22.0 mm in transverse dimensions. no diffusion abnormalities are detected to suggest acute/subacute ischemic changes. after the administration of gadolinium contrast, no evidence of abnormal enhancement is demonstrated. there is no evidence of mass effect or shifting of the normally midline structures, the right temporal ventricular ___ appears preserved, and there is no evidence of effacement of the perimesencephalic cisterns. the ventricles and sulci are prominent for the patient's age, likely consistent with atrophy. normal flow void signal is identified at the major vascular structures. the orbits are grossly normal, the paranasal sinuses demonstrate mild mucosal thickening at the ethmoidal air cells and minimal mucosal thickening on the left side of the sphenoid sinus, the mastoid air cells and maxillary sinuses are normally pneumatized. the visualized aspect of the craniocervical junction appears unremarkable.
there is hydrocephalus with dilatation of the lateral and third ventricles, unchanged. again seen is a ventricular drainage catheter via the left frontal lobe, terminating in the occipital ___ of the left lateral ventricle. there is a cyst with enhancement in the posterior portion of the third ventricle. there is no shift of normally midline structures. there a few scattered foci of increased signal intensity in the right pons and in the right parietal lobe corresponding to the scattered calcifications seen on the patient's recent ct. the partially visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.
there is a left parietal postoperative cavity which has increased in size since the prior examination and there is slight increase in nodular enhancement along its medial aspect. the surrounding edema appears to be stable, however. the left frontal lesion has increased in size and now measures 5 mm, whereas previously it was punctate. a right frontal and possibly leptomeningeal lesion has decreased in size from 8 x 8 mm to 5 x 7 mm. no evidence for acute ischemia or hydrocephalus. intracranial flow voids are maintained. there is opacification of the left sphenoid sinus, which is stable.
overall, this limited study is minimally changed in appearance from that done four days earlier. again visualized is an enhancing mass centered adjacent to the right frontal lobe with extension to the caudate. the mass measures 55 mm ap x 42 mm cc x 39 mm transverse, minimally changed. the calculated enhancing volume is approximately 36.6 cubic cm. as a sequela of the mass, there is a 9-mm leftward shift of normal midline structures, unchanged from the previous study, allowing for the technical differences in measurements. also noted is a small enhancing lesion posteriorly in the right frontal lobe, again unchanged. there are no new lesions. apart from the ___-related compression of the frontal ___ of the right lateral ventricle, the ventricles are otherwise normal in size and configuration.
there has been interval development of numerous (too numerous to count) enhancing lesions throughout the bilateral supratentorial cerebral hemispheres, brainstem (including mid brain, basis pons, and medulla), and cerebellum most consistent with metastatic disease. the majority of these appear to be at the ___-white matter junction; however, some of these are of sufficient peripheral suggesting possible extension or origination within the leptomeningeal space. there is no evidence for hemorrhage or acute infarction. there is a questionable focus of enhancement within the right posterior lateral aspect of the cervical spinal cord at the level of c1/c2 measuring 3.3 mm seen on the coronal images (series 1000, image 76). mri of the cervical spine might be helpful to further assess. there is a stable sellar mass measuring approximately 1.6 cm in the cc diameter, unchanged when compared to the prior exam and likely representing a macroadenoma. there is no evidence for hemorrhage or acute infarction. there is no evidence for hydrocephalus. the visualized major vascular flow voids are unremarkable. the orbital structures are unremarkable. there is mild mucosal thickening of the bilateral ethmoid air cells and right maxillary antrum. there is fluid within the right mastoid air cells. otherwise, the remainder of the paranasal sinuses and left mastoid air cells are clear.
the left temporal/parietal hematoma has decreased in extent, now measuring 18 x 9 mm (previously 25 x 21 mm). it is hyperintense on t1- weighted images, and hyperintense with a peripheral rim of low signal on t2- weighted images, consistent with subacute and chronic blood products. there is no contrast enhancement outside of the hematoma margins on postcontrast images. there is no surrounding edema. there is a moderate amount of t2 hyperintense foci in the white matter of the cerebral hemispheres. a few foci of t2 hyperintensity are also seen within the pons. these findings are likely related to chronic small vessel ischemic disease in a patient of this age. there is no acute hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of the normally midline structures or hydrocephalus. the major vascular flow voids are unremarkable. there is mild opacification of the mastoid air cells bilaterally.
there are new foci of contrast enhancement as follows: 3mm along the right superior frontal gyrus (series 100, image 49), 3 mm along the left middle frontal gyrus (series 100, image 52), 2 mm along the posterior middle frontal gyrus (series 100, image 54), and 2 foci along the left occipital lobe. there is also a new 5 x 2 mm focus of enhancement with a somewhat linear configuration along the left superior cerebellar hemisphere. it is not clear whether these lesions are cortical or leptomeningeal. most of them demonstrate increased susceptibility artifact on the gradient echo images, consistent with associated blood products. there is stable encephalomalacia with chronic blood products involving the right parietal lobe, consistent with a chronic infarct. there has been interval increase in number of chronic infarctions of the right cerebellar hemisphere. chronic infarctions are also seen now in the left cerebellar hemisphere, new from the prior examination. there has been interval increase in number and size of foci of increased susceptibility on the gradient echo images in the cerebral hemispheres at the ___/white matter junction, cerebellum, left caudate head, and right thalamus, consistent with chronic microhemorrhages. no acute infarctions are identified. no hydrocephalus is identified. the visualized major vascular flow voids are unremarkable. bilateral maxillary mucus retention cysts are identified. there is mucosal thickening of the bilateral ethmoid air cells. there is small amount of fluid layering within the bilateral mastoid air cells.
several of the sequences are limited due to excessive motion artifact. allowing for this limitation, the brain appears morphologically normal. there is no mass effect or shift of the normally midline structures. the ventricles and sulci are prominent but symmetric, compatible with involutional change. there are a few discrete foci of t2/flair hyperintensity within the subcortical white matter, compatible with chronic microvascular ischemia. there is no increased susceptibility artifact to indicate the presence of blood products. in addition, there is no restricted diffusion to indicate an ischemic event. normal vascular flow voids are preserved. visualized soft tissues are notable for fluid within the mastoid air cells bilaterally, likely resulting from the patient's recent drowning event.
the study is compared with the most recent nect of ___, as well as previous cts of ___ and ___. corresponding to the low-attenuation region in the right corona radiata and subinsular region, as well as that insular cortex, on the current ct, is a focus of slow diffusion with corresponding hypointensity on the adc map. this demonstrates t2-/flair-hyperintensity and likely represents an early-subacute infarct. there is no evidence of acute infarction elsewhere in the brain. of note, the hypoattenuating regions in right frontal and left paramedian parietovertex subcortical white matter, demonstrated on the ___ and the ___ ct, respectively, demonstrate no correlative signal abnormality on the flair sequence. corresponding to the 5 mm hyperattenuating focus at the lateral aspect of the region of infarction is an abnormal vascular flow void, which demonstrates rounded enhancement, particularly on the mp-rage sequence (111:60), as well as, to a lesser extent, the spin-echo image (23:14). given its peripheral location and isoenhancement to neighboring ___ branches of the mca, this is highly suspicious for a mycotic aneurysm. there is likely a similar enhancing focus, representing a smaller mycotic aneurysm in the right frontal centrum semiovale-___-white matter junction (111:82-84). no definite similar finding is identified elsewhere on the enhanced images, where there is no other parenchymal and no pathologic leptomeningeal or dural focus of enhancement. there is a markedly abnormal appearance to the susceptibility-weighted sequence (series 8). this includes marked superficial siderosis, particularly at the left parietovertex, accompanied by focal volume loss and sulcal dilatation. this corresponds to the region of previous subarachnoid hemorrhage in 1/___. similar, but much less striking abnormality is seen in the corresponding vertex location on the right. however, in addition to these findings, likely chronic, there are numerous additional more punctiform foci of "blooming" susceptibility artifact, largely superficially located throughout both cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres in a nonvascular territorial distribution. there are fewer such foci involving the deeper ___ matter structures. there is at least one focus with more ring-like "blooming" artifact adjacent to the left petrous apex. of note, the most recent nect demonstrates only a solitary punctate calcification, superficially-located at the right frontovertex (2:22, that study), unchanged over the series of studies, with no other calcific, mineralized or frankly hemorrhagic foci to account for the findings on the gre sequence. review of the most recent nect on "lung window" also demonstrates no evidence of pneumocephalus to account for these findings, making diffuse cerebral air emboli less likely. no extra-axial blood or fluid collection is seen. the midline structures are in the midline and the ventricles and cisterns are unchanged in size and configuration over the series of studies, with no evidence of intraventricular hemorrhage. the principal intracranial vascular flow voids, including those of the dural venous sinuses, are preserved (see mra, below) and these structures enhance normally. there is no space-occupying lesion. the sella, parasellar region and remainder of the skull base and orbits are unremarkable. noted are chronic inflammatory changes in the anterior ethmoidal air cells, bilaterally and left frontoethmoidal recess, new since the ___ ct. the mastoid air cells are grossly clear. there is normal flow-related enhancement in the included intracranial portions of both internal carotid and proximal middle and anterior cerebral arteries, with normal, symmetric arborization of mca branches and no significant mural irregularity or flow-limiting stenosis. there is likely a flow-related enhancement into the aneurysmal structure involving the distal m3 segment of the right mca, in the region of the ___ fissure (4:118-121). the other lesion in the right frontal centrum semiovale is not included in the imaging volume. there is normal flow-related enhancement in the distal vertebral arteries, with slightly dominant left vessel, as well as the basilar and bilateral superior cerebellar and posterior cerebral arteries. anterior and robust bilateral posterior communicating vessels are identified, with no aneurysm larger than 3 mm involving the circle of ___. the included portion of the aortic arch and great vessel origins demonstrate normal caliber, contour and contrast enhancement. the common, internal and external carotid arteries demonstrate normal course, caliber, contour and enhancement to the level of the skull base. there is no significant mural irregularity, flow-limiting stenosis or evidence of dissection. roughly co-dominant vertebral arteries demonstrate normal course, caliber, contour and enhancement from their subclavian origins through the vertebrobasilar junction, without significant mural irregularity, flow-limiting stenosis or dissection.
again postoperative changes are seen in the right posterior temporal region. mild surrounding area of increased signal is seen indicating gliosis at the site of surgical cavity. no evidence of abnormal enhancement is seen following the administration of gadolinium. no significant interval change is seen compared to the previous mri study.
there are bilateral subdural collections. the right-sided collection has increased in size compared to ___ with more effacement of sulci and 3-4 mm shift in the septum pellucidum towards the left. the collection is now nearly isointense to csf. it was somewhat hyperintense to csf on the flair and t1 weighted images previously. no residual dural enhancement is seen. the left-sided collection has not changed in size but is no much more t1 hyperintense, most consistent with proteinaceous fluid or subacute hemorrhage. the areas of flair hyperintensity in the cerebral white matter are unchanged, with the most prominent in the mid right centrum semiovale. no abnormal enhancement is seen to suggest an acute process. allowing for the subdural hematomas there is overall atrophy. note is made of prominent sulci in the left parietal lobe inferiorly. the subarachnoid t1 hyperintensity seen previously has resolved.
comparison was made with the mri of ___. there is a small area of restricted diffusion seen in the right posterior putamen measuring 11 x 5 mm. the abnormality is seen and is high signal on diffusion and low signal on adc map consistent with an acute infarct. there are no other acute infarcts identified within the supra- or infratentorial brain. area of chronic encephalomalacia in the left parietal region is identified. chronic appearing watershed infarcts are seen in the left cerebral hemisphere. there is mild-to-moderate brain atrophy seen. minimal to mild changes of small vessel disease are identified. suprasellar and craniocervical regions are unremarkable. the flow void in the left carotid artery is noted to be absent with increased signal indicative of occlusion in the neck. this finding was demonstrated with cta of the same day ___. there is moderate ventriculomegaly seen with minimal dilatation of the temporal horns.
sagittal t1 imaging was performed through the brain. axial imaging was performed using t1, t2, flair, gradient echo and diffusion technique. following administration of intravenous gadolinium contrast, axial t1 and sagittal mp-rage imaging was repeated.
in the interval since the previous exam, there has been a decrease in the degree of edema within the posterior fossa. there is some residual hemosiderin at the site of prior cerebellar hemorrhage. there is a posterior craniotomy defect. there is a small degree of residual encephalomalacia in the inferior left cerebellar hemisphere as well as within the inferior vermis. as on the previous exam, there are linear areas of enhancement along the tracks of previously placed ventricular drains. several small foci of increased t2 and flair signal intensity are identified along the periventricular white matter, suggesting microvascular angiopathy. following contrast administration, no enhancing mass lesions are identified. there is no evidence of vascular anomaly though a small av fistula cannot be excluded. diffusion weighted images again confirm the presence of a focus of increased signal intensity within the right side of the corpus callosum splenium. this area is along the course of the posteriorly placed ventricular drain tract. the ventricles are stable in size. there is no shift of normally midline structures. no extra-axial fluid collections are identified.
the ventricles and extraaxial spaces are normal in size. no evidence of midline shift, mass effect or hydrocephalus is seen. a few small t2 hyperintense areas are identified in the white matter indicating minimal changes of small vessel disease. no evidence of territonal infarcts or blood products is seen. soft tissue changes are seen in the right mastoid air cells.
there is a 5-mm focus of slow diffusion in the white matter of the left parietal lobe, consistent with acute infarction (image 22, series 702). there are extensive scattered and confluent foci of high signal intensity in the periventricular, deep white matter as well as brainstem and cerebellum most consistent with sequelae of chronic microvascular ischemia. there is dilatation of the ventricles as well as the extra-axial spaces, consistent with global parenchymal atrophy. there is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. the midline structures are central. there is a mucus retention cyst in the inferior right maxillary sinus. the remaining paranasal sinuses are clear. the intracranial flow voids are preserved. there is a 17 mm area of scalp thickening over the left vertex.
patient motion severely limits evaluation and assessment for residual tumor cannot be determined without contrast enhanced images. post- surgical changes are noted following a right frontal craniotomy, with high t1 signal seen within the surgical bed, measuring approximately 2.5 cm, likely reflecting hemorrhagic products within the surgical bed. there continues to be considerable associated vasogenic edema within the right frontal lobe and mass effect on the right lateral ventricle. however, there is no shift of normally midline structures or herniation. there is no evidence of infarct. the previously identified lesion in the left medial temporal lobe is not well identified on today's study. additionally, there is faint suggestion of a left cerebellar lesion, as noted on prior mr ___ ___, but assessment is again limited due to patient motion.
a new enhancing lesion is noted in the left posterior temporal lobe, measuring 9 x 8 x 8 mm in craniocaudad, ap and transverse dimensions (series 11a, image 44). there is mild flair hyperintensity surrounding the lesion. a new extra-axial dural based lesion is noted in the right parietal region (series 11a, image 76), measuring 6 x 7 mm. a small new extra-axial dural based enhancing lesion is noted in right anterior temporal region (series 11a, image 42) measuring 5 mm. a new enhancing lesion is noted in the left frontal scalp measuring 12 x 9 mm with thinning of the underlying bone (series 11a, image 79). stable postoperative changes are noted in the form of bifrontal craniotomy and encephalomalacic area in bilateral frontal lobes (right more than left). dural thickening with enhancement is noted in bifrontal region which is unchanged since the prior study and likely represents postoperative change. there is no evidence of infarction. there is no evidence of shift of midline structures. the ventricles are unchanged in size. the brainstem and cerebellum appear normal. the major intracranial flow voids are noted. post cataract extraction status is noted of bilateral globes. mucosal thickening is noted in bilateral ethmoid air cells and mastoid air cells.
there are postsurgical changes in the right frontal lobe with persistent mild dural enhancement at the surgical resection bed, similar appearance compared to prior (9:16). adjacent to the surgical bed, there is a tiny nodular focus of enhancement measuring 4 mm (12:26) with no significant interval change. there is stable edema about the surgical bed and nodular focus of enhancement(4:16). there is interval decrease in size in right frontal dural-based lesion, now measuring 13 x 10 mm in axial diameter (9:17), 7 mm in craniocaudal diameter, (12a:53) with interval decrease in size compared to prior with stable edema. previously seen punctate focus of enhancement at the left vertex is not appreciated on the current scan. there is a punctate focus of enhancement at the left vertex (9:19). there is no evidence of acute hemorrhage, acute infarction or hydrocephalus. the ventricles and sulci are slightly prominent, related to mild volume loss. there are bilateral multiple nonenhancing flair hyperintense foci in keeping with small vessel ischemic changes. there is mild persistent diffuse dural enhancement in the frontal and the parietal lobes as seen on prior study. the visualized portion of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells appear within normal limits. there is normal signal in the bone. the globes are intact. there is normal flow void in the major arteries.
there are small foci of increased t2 signal in the subcortical and periventricular white matter of both cerebral hemispheres. these may represent areas of microvascular infarction or demyelination. there is no evidence of cortical infarction. there are no diffusion signal abnormalities. gre images demonstrate small areas of susceptibility artifact within the postoperative right frontal subdural space. there is also susceptibility artifact related to clips placed in the location of the right middle cerebral artery bifurcation. the overall morphology of the brain is unchanged since the previous studies. the ventricles are stable and small. mr ___ ___ flow in both intracranial internal carotid arteries and in the anterior and middle cerebral arterial branches. there is a large area of flow signal dropout around the right middle cerebral arterial clips. the area of aneurysm treatment cannot be evaluated. there is flow in both intracranial vertebral arteries, the basilar artery and the proximal superior cerebellar and posterior cerebral arteries.
there is an intrinsically t1 hyperintense collection again noted in the left parietal lobe, decreased in size since the prior examination, and most consistent with expected evolution of an intraparenchymal hemorrhage. the hematoma now measures 3.6 ap x 2.3 tv x 2.9 si cm compared with the prior examination where it measured 4.9 x 2.8 x 4.4 cm. there has also been a decrease in the surrounding t2 and flair hyperintensity, representing resolving vasogenic edema. while there is no discrete underlying enhancing focus identified, given the continued intrinsic hyperintensity, a small focus of underlying tumor cannot be completely excluded. t2 and flair hyperintense foci are again noted in the periventricular, subcortical and deep white matter, similar in distribution and extent as on the prior study. the ventricles, sulci, and cisterns remain mildly enlarged. there is no midline shift. there is no extra-axial fluid collection. there is no decreased diffusion to indicate an acute infarct. the soft tissue in the right nasal cavity extending through the piriform aperture as well as into the right maxillary sinus is stable in appearance, with t2 hyperintensity and enhancement. there has been no interval change in the size of this mass. the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are otherwise unremarkable. the orbits and soft tissues are also unremarkable.
on diffusion images, no evidence of acute infarct seen in the brain or in the brainstem. the ventricles and extra-axial spaces are normal in size without midline shift, mass effect, or hydrocephalus. there is no evidence of significant subcortical white matter ischemic disease or territorial infarct seen. a subtle area of high signal is seen on flair and t2-weighted images in the mid portion of the pons, which demonstrates subtle enhancement following gadolinium. most likely this represents an incidental capillary telangiectasia. other pathologies such as infarct, central pontine myelinolysis or neoplastic lesion are less likely given the appearances. small fluid level is seen in the left maxillary sinus. mild mucosal thickening is seen in both maxillary sinuses. following gadolinium administration, no abnormal parenchymal, vascular, or meningeal enhancement of the brain is identified.
similar to the prior examinations, post-surgical changes along the right temporal convexity are noted with a sleever of t2/flair hyperintensity in the extra-axial space along the right temporal convexity, likely related to prior duraplasty. there is mild stable enhancement of the subjacent dura. within the surgical cavity, a cystic lesion with thick and nodular peripheral enhancement, particularly posteriorly, is again noted. while the enhancement is unchanged since the prior examination, the size of the cystic lesion may be slightly smaller and now measures 23 (ap) x 15 (trv) x 22 mm (cc). there is persistent surrounding flair signal which may represent a combination of edema, post-treatment change and tumor infiltration, stable. there is persistent dilatation of the right temporal ___. there is also low signal on the susceptibility sequence in the surgical cavity/cystic lesion in keeping with old blood products. there is no evidence of new focus of enhancement, hemorrhage or infarct. there is no midline shift or hydrocephalus. the visualized flow voids are unremarkable. there is fluid-opacification of the mastoid air cells, bilaterally, stable. there is mild mucosal thickening of the frontal and ethmoid air cells.
when compared to ___, there is no interval progress with regard to the sella mass, measuring 16 (ap) x 22 (trv) x 22 (cc) mm. the mass appears to originate in the sella turcica and spans the bony floor as well as its anterior margin. it has a characteristic snowman configuration and extends through the diaphragma sellae into the suprasellar cistern. significant mass effect is seen on the optic chiasm, the optic tract as well as the a1 segments. the mass abuts the cavernous sinus bilaterally. however, there is no evidence of cavernous sinus invasion or encasement of the cavernous sinus ica segments. the remainder of the exam is unremarkable. specifically, there are no new contrast-enhancing lesions. the imaged paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are unremarkable on t1 images.
the examination is limited by significant patient motion artifact. within this limitation, clearly evident is an evolving right cerebellar hemispheric infarct which results in significant mass effect upon the fourth ventricle and cervicomedullary junction. central "bloomin" susceptibility artifact is compatible with hemorrhagic conversion. there is progressive herniation of the right cerebellar tonsil through the foramen magnum. otherwise, there is global atrophy and extensive t2-hyperintensity throughout bihemispheric white matter, compatible with sequelae of chronic microvascular disease. there is mild ventricular enlargement commensurate with the overall degree of atrophy. there is abnormal signal at the level of c2, likely relating to a chronic ununited fracture, better demonstrated on the recent cervical spine ct scan. there is a cephalohematoma overlying the right frontal bone.
the patient is status post left occipital craniotomy for resection of partly cystic enhancing mass. there are expected postoperative changes with dural thickening, enhancement and minimal pneumencephalus. the resection cavity is filled by blood products and fluid. while there is linear enhancement along the margin of the resectin site, there is no nodular component, suggesting residual tumor in this first postoperative baseline study. perilesional flair hyperintensity is extending to the left atrium and unchanged from the prior. the right frontal cortical lesion is stable, measuring 8.3 mm. there is no evidence of new metastatic foci. flow voids of the major intracranial vessels are preserved. no area of restricted diffusion is identified. the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. the orbits and osseous structures are unremarkable.
there is periventricular hyperintense signal along the margins of the lateral ventricles. a few flair hyperintense foci are noted scattered in the subcortical white matter in the frontal lobes. there is slightly hyperintense signal noted adjacent to the occipital horns and along the forceps; the significance of this finding is uncertain. subtle involvement related to pres cannot be completely excluded. there is no focus of slow diffusion to suggest an acute infarct. there is no focus of negative susceptibility. the major intracranial arterial flow voids are noted. mild mucosal thickening is noted in the ethmoid air cells on both sides.
within the area of the left posterior parietal lobe where the tumor was previously seen, there is evidence of hyperintensity on flair and t2w images consistent with hemorrhage. the post gadolinium images do not show any area of abnormal enhancement. however, the previous mass showed minimal to no gadolinium enhancement. there is also some dural enhancement over this lesion which is consistent with postoperative changes. no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or new mass lesions. note is made of a soft tissue focus within the left parotid which seems to have hyperintensity on t1w images consistent with fat. no evidence of hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures. minor or major vascular territorial infarcts are not apparent.

there are again postoperative changes status post right parietal craniotomy with resection of the previous large right frontal mass lesion. susceptibility artifact related to old blood products is again noted in the region of surgery, as is increased flair signal in the adjacent frontal lobe which likely reflects encephalomalacia. there are two small faintly enhancing foci in the pons not apparent on any other sequence, unchanged from the prior examination, and given persistence are less likely to represent artifact than true lesions such as capillary telangiectasia. postoperative dural thickening and enhancement over the right frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes is decreased from prior. there is an unchanged 10 x 10 mm extra-axial dural-based enhancing mass in the left posterior fossa with mild mass effect on the adjacent cerebellum abuts the tentorium and transverse sinus. there is an unchanged t2 hyperintense, t1 hypointense non-enhancing lesion in the clivus with an intradural, retroclival component as well as extension superolaterally to the left within the clivus which abuts the posterior wall of the left ica; there are areas of associated bony erosion. there is high signal on diffusion within this lesion. there is no other area of abnormality in the brain. there is no abnormal diffusion to suggest ischemia. no evidence of acute hemorrhage. major intravascular flow voids are preserved.
the patient has undergone prior resection of a bifrontal mass, and post-operative changes are present in the resection bed, including fat as packing material. immediately deep to the packing material, a region of t1 hypointensity, t2 hyperintensity indicates a small region of post-operative encephalomalacia. within this area, a small focus of slow diffusion indicates a small post-operative infarct. in the posterior, inferior aspect of the resection bed, there is a small residual enhancing mass measuring approximately 11 x 25 mm. since the immediately preceding study, there has been a marked decrease in the degree of surrounding edema. within the resection bed itself, there is no collection or evidence of abscess. however, tracking along the left cerebral convexity is a small, t2-hyperintense post-operative collection which is new from the immediately post-operative study of ___. elsewhere within the brain, there is no hemorrhage, other area of edema, other mass, mass effect, or infarct. no other abnormalities are noted on diffusion imaging. there is no other abnormal enhancement after contrast administration. ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration. above the resection bed, a small amount of brain parenchyma herniates through the calvarial defect, which remains well covered by overlying soft tissues.

the diffusion images demonstrate several areas of slow diffusion involving the left periventricular region and right frontal lobe as well as in the left posterior frontal cortical region. subtle enhancement is also identified in these regions, but evaluation on the post-gadolinium images is limited secondary to motion. these findings are suspicious for septic emboli. a repeat post-gadolinium study would be helpful for further assessment if clinically indicated. moderate ventriculomegaly and prominence of sulci are noted due to brain atrophy. moderate periventricular changes of small vessel disease are also seen.
area of predominantly t1 and t2 hypointensity, with susceptibility artifact in the right basal ganglia at the location of prior hemorrhage appears smaller than prior study compatible with evolution of hemorrhage. there is no evidence of new bleed. susceptibility artifact along the lateral wall of the right lateral ventricle (5:16) likely represents blood products/hemosiderosis of the wall of the lateral ventricle. there is no hydrocephalus. the extra-axial spaces and ventricles are within normal limits in size and unchanged since prior study. there is mild increased flair t2 signal surrounding the area of hematoma compatible with gliosis-edema. tiny foci of t2-flair hyperintensity in the periventricular-subcortical white matter are most compatible with sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. the area of hematoma in the right basal ganglia demonstrates decreased there is a somewhat linear/stellate enhancement within this area with connection to the lateral ventricle ependymal surface. there is no mass effect or acute infarction. there is no evidence of new bleed. paranasal sinuses demonstrate minimal mucosal thickening in the ethmoid sinus air cells, otherwise unremarkable. the imaged orbits are unremarkable. the intracranial arteries and the dural sinuses are patent. dominant left vertebral artery is stable.

there is t1 hyperintense and t2 hyperintense heterogeneous signal in the left subdural collection. there is a large postero-superior component of the subdural hematoma which indents and displaces the left parietal lobe. the overall extent and configuration of this subdural collection is not significantly changed, compared to ct scans. there is no clear evidence of edema in the underlying parietal lobe or elsewhere within the brain. there are small areas of increased t2 signal which likely reflects microvascular infarction. due to mass effect, there is flattening of the left lateral ventricle and mild dilatation of the right lateral ventricle. this too, is stable. within the subdural collection, heterogeneous signal suggests that there are loculations and membranes. these appear to be separating some components of the more anterior aspect of the collection, as well as segregating the large posterior collection from other components. small amounts of subdural blood have collected inferior to the cerebellum, and also anterior to the right frontal lobe. there is no mass effect on the structures adjacent to these small collections. flow signal is observed in the proximal branches of the circle of ___.
there is no evidence for acute hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or recent infarction. the ___-white matter differentiation is preserved. the region of encephalomalacia within the left occipital lobe demonstrates subtle enhancement. the lesion appears to contain blood products from a prior hemorrhage. the paucity of enhancement suggests that this could be an av fistula rather than avm, however, an enlarged vein at the region of the formation does suggest av shunt. there are multiple prior hemorrhages within the basal ganglia of chronic appearance. there are t2 and flair hyperintensities in the periventricular and deep white matter consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic disease. there is prominence of the ventricles and sulci, not out of proportion to age. the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are unremarkable.

there is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. multiple tiny dwi hyperintense lesions track linearly along the white matter of the coronae radiatae and centra semiovale, bilaterally (502:21). the majority are new since the ___ examination and are correspondingly-hypointense on the adc map, compatible with small acute infarcts in a watershed distribution. no vascular territorial infarct is seen. multiple scalp lesions are redemonstrated, compatible with known history metastatic renal cancer. a dominant vertex midline mass (9:136) extends from the surface of the scalp, through the calvaria into the underlying pachymeninges, with focal dural thickening. this is unchanged since the prior exam. there has been interval increase in pachymeningeal thickening on post-contrast images (901:39) most compatible with progression of dural seeding. a left frontal scalp lesion (10:14) currently measures 37 x 29 mm, enlarged since the ___ examination, with a subgaleal base, but no transgression of the subjacent outer table of the calvaria. however, two right-sided scalp lesions involve the bony cortex. the first, measuring 15 x 11 mm (10:19), clearly breaches both the inner and outer tables, and is accompanied by focal thickening of the underlying dura. at the superior-most aspect of this process, there is an ill-defined projection subjacent to the dura, concerning for subarachnoid infiltration, new since the ___ study (10:18). a second scalp-based lesion demonstrates interval obsuration of the border with the inner table (10:18), with new corresponding dwi- signal abnormality subjacent to the bony cortex and within the diploic space (502:20), indicating early encroachment through the calvaria and involvement of the marrow of the skull.
two intraparenchymal masses are again identified in the left cerebral hemisphere. these lesions both show areas of t1 hyperintensity and increased susceptibility, consistent with products of hemorrhage. the left frontal lesion has increased in size. the occipital lesion has decreased, likely due to resorption of products of hemorrhage. there is persistent but decreased associated vasogenic edema in the adjacent white matter with decreased mass effect compared to the prior study. there is a new small lesion in the right frontal lobe anteriorly. this enhances and also shows elevated susceptibility, consistent with a component of hemorrhage. no other new lesions are identified.

there is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect or infarction. ventricles and sulci are normal in caliber and configuration. no diffusion abnormalities are detected to suggest acute infarct. on non- contrast imaging, there are no findings to suggest abscess or cerebritis. on t2 and flair imaging, there are scattered punctate and confluent bihemispheric subcortical and periventricular white matter hyperintensities. this is a non- specific finding, and may relate to chronic microvascular infarction. there is fluid and mucosal thickening within the right maxillary sinus. imaging of the left maxillary sinus is limited by susceptibility artifact, and is better evaluated on recent head ct.
the study is compared with the nect obtained roughly 11 hours earlier. again demonstrated is the extensive subdural collection layering over the entire right cerebral convexity which demonstrates mixed signal intensity, likely representing a subdural hematoma with blood products of different ages. this measures roughly 14 mm in maximal thickness from the inner table of the skull with 8 mm leftward shift of the normally-midline structures, likely not significantly changed (allowing for differences in modality and section selection and angulation). also demonstrated is a thin subdural collection, measuring no more than 2 mm in thickness, overlying the left occipital pole, with no significant mass effect. the suprasellar and remaining basal cisterns are preserved, with no evidence of central herniation. there is a tubular t1-intermediate- and flair-hyperintense structure at the left parietovertex, corresponding to the hyperattenuating focus at this site on the ct, which may represent a thrombosed cortical vein, but there is no associated flair-signal abnormality to suggest edema in the region. the principal dural venous sinuses appear patent by flow-void. there are scattered punctate and round flair-hyperintensities, particularly in the right corona radiata and left hemipons, likely the sequelae of chronic microvascular ischemic disease. however, allowing for the limited nature of the study, there is no finding to suggest vascular territorial infarction. the principal intracranial arterial flow-voids are preserved.

again noted is a large subacute hematoma in the left frontal lobe causing subfalcine herniation, of approximately 9 mm, which is unchanged compared to the prior study. there is significant surrounding edema and a small sliver of an extra-axial fluid collection. no enhancing abnormality is seen to suggest an underlying mass. there is restricted diffusion within the hematoma which can be seen with subacute hematomas. there are a few scattered foci of signal dropout in a punctate fashion in the left temporal and parietal lobes, which have progressed since the prior study. these could be related to amyloid angiopathy or old hypertensive microbleeds, if the patient has the appropriate clinical history. again noted are changes from a right frontal craniotomy, reportedly for meningioma resection. there are encephalomalacic changes but no evidence for recurrent or residual neoplasm. no uncal herniation seen on this examination. there are scattered small vessel ischemic sequelae in the subcortical and periventricular white matter and grossly stable since the prior examination. intracranial flow voids are maintained. there is a small left maxillary sinus mucous retention cyst.

there are multiple areas of restricted diffusion, involving the right cerebellar hemisphere, the occipital lobes bilaterally, right greater than left, the right temporal lobe along the hippocampus, and the right thalamus. these are bright on the flair images. apart from these areas, there are t2/flair hyperintensities in the periventricular and subcortical white matter compatible with small vessel ischemic disease. there is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. there are air-fluid levels in the maxillary sinuses, right greater than left as well as mucosal thickening in the maxillary, sphenoid, ethmoid and frontal air cells. the ventricles and sulci are normal in caliber and configuration.
images through the brain demonstrate changes of small vessel disease of the periventricular and subcortical white matter without midline shift, mass effect or hydrocephalus. no evidence of acute infarct is identified. images through the posterior fossa and iac demonstrate extensive bilateral mastoid air cell soft tissue changes. on the left side, there is fluid seen within the middle ear cavity, mastoid antrum as well as hypotympanum. in addition, abnormal signal is identified at the left petrous apex, including a well-defined area of fluid collection on ciss or on fiesta images within the bony structure. coronal post images demonstrate indistinct superior margin of the petrous bone on the left side in the region of tegmen tympani suspicious for erosive change. no definite evidence of enhancement of the meninges or abnormal signal seen in the left temporal bone. the findings are indicative of extensive and destructive inflammatory changes involving the left temporal bone and involvement of the left petrous apex but inflammatory process. subtle enhancement of the meninges is seen within the left internal auditory canal without definite evidence of enhancement of the intrinsic enhancement of the seventh or eighth nerves. evaluation of the left flow within the left transverse sinuses demonstrate no evidence of filling defect on post-gadolinium images. the left carotid canal is adjacent to the inflammatory changes with normal persistent flow void within the carotid artery.

there is no parenchymal signal or structural abnormality. there are no findings of acute or prior cortical infarct. the ventricles are normal, as are the flow voids. there is mild mucosal thickening within the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses.
within the left posterotemporoparietal operative site, there is an approximately 2.7 cm area of blood breakdown products with central methemoglobin and peripheral hemosiderin. deoxy- and methemoglobin were visible on the postoperative study from ___. that study was quite limited by patient motion. superior to the blood breakdown products, there is an approximately 1-cm-thick area of enhancement with central t1 hypointensity suggesting recurrent tumor. it involves the parietal lobe and posterior frontal lobe. superior to the tumor, there is an old left parietal infarct with cortical and subcortical encephalomalacia and gyriform enhancment. it is not well seen on the pre- or postoperative mris, but appears old. at the inferoposterior aspect of the tumor, nodular enhancement, consistent with residual tumor, projects around the atrium of the left lateral ventricle into the occipital white matter. this projection has become bulkier compared to the properative study, consistent with interval growth of the tumor. there is resolution of the preoperative and postoperative mass effect and the left lateral ventricle is now only minimally smaller than the right. the surrounding t2 hyperintensity is not significantly changed compared to the postoperative study which was limited by patient motion. there is an old infarct in the superomedial right cerebellar hemisphere, faintly visualized on prior studies. the sulci are normal in size.

a rim-enhancing lesion is seen in the right frontal lobe with surrounding edema measuring approximately 3 x 2 cm. a rim-enhancing lesion is also seen in the left frontal lobe with surrounding edema measuring approximately 3.5 x 2.5 cm. no other enhancing brain lesions are identified. there is no midline shift is seen. mild mass effect is seen on the left lateral ventricle.
there is an evolving hematoma in the lateral right temporal lobe that measures approximately 3.9 cm in maximal dimension. it is characterized by central intermediate t1 signal intensity and slight t2 hypointensity, probably a combination of residual deoxyhemoglobin and intracellular methemoglobin, peripheral ring of t1 and t2 hyperintense extracellular methemoglobin and a thin rim of hemosiderin. the appearance is most consistent with a several- week-old hemorrhage. it is not seen on the study from ___. there is surrounding edema and some effacement of the right temporal sulci and indentation of the anterior temporal ___. there has been evolution of the more medial hemorrhage in the right lentiform nucleus and corona radiata, seen on the ___ ct and subsequent mri. it has decreased in size and is now characterized by extensive hemosiderin and some slight central methemoglobin. the right lateral ventricle remains slightly smaller than the left, probably in part related to the more acute temporal abnormality. at the posterior margin of the hemorrhage there remains an area of t2 hyperintensity that is of high signal intensity on diffusion weighted images, unchanged from ___. periventricular t2 hyperintensity and more peripheral foci of t2 hyperintensity are again noted. there is prominence of the ventricular system, unchanged. the results were e-mailed to dr. ___ at approximately 21:00 on ___.
images through the brain demonstrate normal ventricles and extra- axial spaces without midline shift, mass effect, hydrocephalus, or acute infarct. there is no mass effect or midline shift seen. following gadolinium, no abnormal enhancement is noted. images through the temporal lobes demonstrate symmetric appearances of both hippocampi and other medial temporal lobe structures. no mri signs of mesial temporal sclerosis are seen. the coronal mp-rage images demonstrate well maintained ___-white matter differentiation without signs of ___ matter heterotopias, other migration, or brain formation abnormalities.
the study is compared with the recent enhanced mr examination of the brain, dated ___ (performed for "altered mental status and right greater than left foot clonus"); the overall appearance is significantly worse. on the previous study, there was flair-signal abnormality limited to bilateral cortical sulci, indicative of a process limited to the subarachnoid space, while now there are numerous confluent and rounded flair-hyperintense foci, with somewhat gyriform pattern, with scattered patchy involvement of the ___ matter of both cerebral hemispheres. this most strikingly involves the insular and medial temporal lobe cortices, bilaterally, as well as the right orbitofrontal gyrus, extending to that gyrus rectus, all of which demonstrate relatively uniform swelling. there is notable sparing of the deep ___ matter structures, as well as the pons and cerebellum. of note, there is no definite accompanying abnormality of diffusion to specifically indicate cytotoxic edema, no "blooming" susceptibility artifact to indicate hemorrhage, and no corresponding parenchymal enhancement. furthermore, there is no definite abnormal leptomeningeal or dural enhancement (also absent on the previous study). the major intracranial vascular flow- voids, including those of the dural venous sinuses, are preserved, and these structures enhance normally following contrast administration (see dedicated mrv, below). finally, there is extensive fluid- opacification involving the mastoid air cells, as well as the right sphenoid sinus and its pterygoid recess, significantly worse since the previous mr (though the right pterygoid recess was opacified at that time), as well as the ct cervical spine, dated ___. there is normal flow-related enhancement in the major dural venous sinuses, as well as the deep cerebral venous structures, with no "filling defect" or other finding to suggest major cerebral venous thrombosis.
again t2 hyperintense area identified in the left parietal and posterior temporal region with predominant changes in the white matter and involvement of the adjacent cortex. there is displacement of the white matter in the surrounding region as seen on the diffusion anisotropic image. following gadolinium, subtle high signal is identified in the region of t2 hyperintensity on the t1 axial images but not recognized on mp-rage images. this is likely secondary to magnetization transfer effect on the t1-weighted images. there is no distinct enhancement identified. the arterial spin level perfusion imaging demonstrated no evidence of increased perfusion in the region of abnormality. the previously identified area of increased perfusion seen in the marginal aspect of the lesion is no longer visible. conceivably this could be secondary to labeled spins within the adjacent vein producing an artifact. there is no other abnormality seen within the brain. no mass effect or hydrocephalus identified.

owing to differences in patient positioning and technique, there has been slight interval decrease to no significant interval change in size or appearance of the approximately 24 mm ap x 15 mm transverse right cavernous sinus mass. the mass extends through the superior orbital fissure to the orbital apex, into the nasopharyngeal soft tissues on the right, and projects into the right sphenoid sinus. persistent heterogeneous signal intensity is noted within the right side of the clivus, likely secondary to treatment. the tumor is again seen to abut the lateral aspect of the right cavernous internal carotid artery with normal internal carotid artery flow voids. prominent soft tissue posterior to the dens, without involvement of the c2 body or odontoid process, unchanged. there is diffuse t2/flair signal hyperintensity within the periventricular and deep subcortical white matter. there is no evidence of restricted diffusion to suggest acute ischemia. the ventricular system and cortical sulci are prominent and appropriate in size for the patient's age of 77 years. no new enhancing lesions are identified. again seen is loculated fluid within the right sphenoid sinuses and mucosal thickening of multiple bilateral ethmoid air cells in the left maxillary sinus. fluid persists in the right mastoid air cells.

comparison is made to the previous ct of the brain performed on ___. there is susceptibility artifact and encephalomalacia involving the right posterior temporal and occipital lobes, in the location of the previously identified hemorrhage. there is dilatation of the right temporal ___ and right ventricular atrium due to volume loss. susceptibility images also demonstrate other foci of signal hypointensity in the basal ganglia and at the cortical margin of the cerebrum, especially the left parietal and right frontal lobes. these may be sites of other remote small hemorrhages. diffusion weighted scans do not reveal any areas of acute infarction/restricted diffusion. there are patchy inconfluent areas of increased t2 signal throughout the cerebral white matter. this likely reflects microvascular ischemia and infarction and was appreciated on previous ct scans. there is no appreciable shift of structures. there are no abnormal extra- axial collections. 3d time-of-flight mr ___ ___ flow in both intracranial carotid arteries and in the anterior and middle cerebral arterial branches. no definite areas of flow limiting stenosis or aneurysm formation are seen in the anterior circulation. there is no flow identified within the right intracranial vertebral artery. the left vertebral artery appears continuous with the basal artery. flow is seen in the proximal posterior cerebral arteries.
accounting for slight differences in scan plane, the enhancing mass and signal abnormality involving the left basal ganglia and superomedial left temporal lobe is not appreciably changed since the previous study. mass effect and ventricular size and configuration are unchanged. there are no new areas of abnormality visualized. increased t2 signal is present within the left cerebral white matter and to a more moderate degree in the right cerebral white matter. this likely represents a combination of tumor, edema, and treatment effects.
there is a small parieto-occipital hyperintensity on the diffusion- weighted images, which is too small to fully characterize (302, 16). there is no corresponding abnormality on the adc or flair images. this may represent artefact however a tiny acute infarct cannot be excluded. there is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. there is mild periventricular t2 hyperintensity consistent with microvascular disease. the ventricles and sulci are mildly prominent but not changed. mra shows normal intracranial vertebral and internal carotid arteries and their major branches without evidence of stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm formation.

there is increased signal on diffusion-weighted images in bilateral occipital lobes (right greater than left), in these areas, there is also increase in flair signal. these findings are consistent with a subacute infarct at the occipital lobe. there is also a small area of increased flair and diffusion signal in the left temporal lobe which likely represent a small infarct, which is also probably subacute considering the increased signal on the flair images. this could encompass a distribution of the temporal branch of the posterior cerebral artery. there is increased diffusion signal in the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres without increased flair signal in these areas. these findings are consistent with acute cerebellar infarcts. there is also increased t2 signal in the right frontal lobe near the vertex, which does not demonstrate increased signal in the diffusion-weighted images and likely represents a late subacute or chronic infarct in that area. there is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normal midline structures, or major vascular territorial infarcts. mra of the circle of ___: the right vertebral artery is small and no definite flow could be demonstrated. it is unclear whether this vessel is thrombosed or just is too small to demonstrate flow or there is reversal of blood flow in this vessel. the left vertebral artery, the basilar, and the remaining vessels of the posterior circulation are patent. the visualized branches of the internal carotid arteries are also patent. there is no evidence of stenosis or aneurysm dilatation in these vessels.

there is swelling of the soft tissues of the posterior scalp, likely representing a hematoma. on the diffusion-weighted images, there is increased signal within the genu of the left internal capsule as well as within the cortex of both frontal lobes. these regions are also high signal on flair and the left internal capsule region is high signal on t2. although these could represent areas of t2 shine through, this is less likely as a signal intensity within these regions is higher on the diffusion images than t2 or flair. there is no shift of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus or abnormal areas of susceptibility to indicate acute hemorrhage. there is mucosal thickening and air fluid levels within the ethmoid air cells, sphenoid sinuses and left maxillary sinus. there is mild mucosal thickening to a lesser degree in the right maxillary sinus.

diffusion images demonstrate an area of acute subcortical periventricular infarct in the right periventricular region adjacent to the posterior portion of the body of the right lateral ventricle. subtle hyperintensities in the left periventricular region and right occipital region on diffusion images appear to be t2 shine through or could be due to subacute infarcts. diffuse small vessel disease is identified in the white matter. several subcortical lacunes are seen in both basal ganglia region. thalami also demonstrate chronic infarcts. there is mild to moderate brain atrophy seen. vascular flow voids are maintained.

the study is significantly limited due to motion artifact, rendering the t2 sequence nondiagnostic. multiple attempts did not significantly improve motion artifact due to patient's inability to hold still. within the limitations of the study, there is a t1 hypointense lobulated intraventricular mass involving the left lateral ventricle and measuring 1.8 x 1.4 cm. a ventriculostomy catheter is noted in situ, frontal approach. the ventricles are asymmetric with left ventricle being relatively dilated, this could result from mass effect due to the intraventricular tumor. there are no other obvious lesions, masses on pre- contrastr t1- weighted images.

again seen are extensive post-treatment changes predominantly throughout the left cerebral hemisphere with atrophy and volume loss. changes are greatest in the left temporal lobe where there is a cystic space with debris and fluid level. this does not appear changed from the prior examination. as seen on multiple prior examinations, there has been evolution of contents in this region with debris, likely some of which is hemorrhage, presumed to be post-surgical change. no evidence of new enhancing lesion is seen. multiple scattered foci of hemorrhage may be related to radiation therapy or micro-hemorrhage; however, are unchanged. extensive white matter abnormality, left greater than right, appears unchanged and may be related to post-treatment change. generalized prominence of the ventricles and sulci reflects global atrophy, left greater than right. multiple lacunes are seen, greater on the left, similar to the prior examination. no concerning diffusion abnormality is seen. the major intracranial vessel flow voids are preserved. a small amount of fluid is noted within the mastoid air cells bilaterally.
3d time-of-flight arteriography of the head was obtained, multiple maximal intensity projections and axial source images were provided.
as noted on the previous studies, there are extensive foci of increased t2 signal in the subcortical and periventricular white matter of both cerebral hemispheres. these likely represent microvascular infarctions. they are numerous and it is difficult to be sure there has not been progression since the previous study. there are no areas of diffusion signal abnormality to indicate recent infarction. there is a tiny lacune in each cerebellar hemisphere. there is no intracranial mass effect. the ventricles are not dilated. there is flow in the major branches of the circle of ___. post-gadolinium images reveal no abnormal enhancing foci within the brain or extraaxial spaces. there is no abnormal intracranial susceptibility artifact.
there is no slow diffusion to indicate an acute infarct. there is a 1.3 x 1.8 cm intensely enhancing intra-axial mass in the white matter of the left frontal lobe. there is a large amount of adjacent vasogenic edema. there is mild associated mass effect with 5 mm of subfalcine herniation. there is no uncal herniation. no additional enhancing foci are identified. there are no areas of abnormal magnetic susceptibility. this study is somewhat limited due to patient motion artifact. there are several scattered foci of increased t2 signal on the flair sequence within the periventricular and subcortical white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, most consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic change. these findings are also noted within the pons. no associated enhancing abnormalities are noted within these areas. the previously mentioned densely enhancing left frontal lobe mass has a tiny focus of magnetic susceptibility within it which could indicate a small focus of intratumoral hemorrhage or calcium. the differential diagnosis of this mass includes a primary brain neoplasm or a metastasis. however, cerebral metastases from cervical cancer are considered rare. the degree of vasogenic edema, however, would favor a metastatic process.
there is no hemorrhage, mass effect, edema, acute infarction or hydrocephalus. post-contrast images demonstrate no evidence of enhancing mass. a hypointensity in the right frontal lobe on gre images may represent old microhemorrhage versus cavernoma. no evidence of new septic emboli are seen. hyperintensities within the periventricular white matter on flair images are suggestive of chronic microvascular ischemic disease. prominent ventricles and sulci are compatible with mild global age-related atrophy, unchanged since ___. principal vascular flow voids are preserved. globes and soft tissues are unremarkable. mucus retention cyst is seen within the left maxillary sinus. he remainder of the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
study is compared with enhanced mr examination dated ___, where the additional history of "marginal-zone lymphoma" was given. again demonstrated is moderate proportionate prominence of the sulci and fissures and the ventricles and cisterns, representing global atrophy. there is relatively mild multifocal and patchy ___ in bihemispheric subcortical more than periventricular white matter, indicative of chronic microvascular infarction, with chronic lacunes in the anterior right corona radiata, unchanged. there is no evidence of restricted diffusion to indicate acute infarction, and the major intracranial vascular flow voids, including those of the dural venous sinuses, are preserved and these structures enhance normally. there is no pathologic focus of parenchymal, leptomeningeal or dural enhancement to suggest intracranial metastasis. the sella, parasellar region, skull base, orbits and paranasal sinuses are unremarkable, with no evidence of bone destruction involving the skull.
again visualized is a large hematoma centered at the left superior cerebellar hemisphere and vermis, which appears similar in size to the previous ct studies. t2 images show blood-fluid levels within it, suggesting internal evolution of this hematoma. the surrounding edema, is more prominent than that on the previous ct particularly the extension anteriorly into the middle cerebellar peduncle. associated with this edema is effacement of the left aspect of the quadrigeminal plate and the left ambient cistern, consistent with upward transtentorial herniation. the fourth ventricle is effaced and displaced to the right. the third and lateral ventricles are normal in size and configuration. periventricular hyperintensity on flair images is more likely chronic small vessel infarction, given the rim of normal tissue immediately adjacent to the ventricles making transependymal migration of csf less likely. there is no intra- or perilesional enhancement on post- contrast images. there is no abnormal enhancement of the parenchyma, leptomeninges or dura. there are no feeding vessels seen at the level of the hematoma. mprage images show no evidence of venous sinus thrombosis or active extravasation. otherwise, the supratentorial brain shows no hemorrhage, edema or vascular territory infarct. there is no lateral shift of normal midline anatomy.

there has been interval left-sided craniotomy, with small amount of left- sided pneumocephalus and fluid along the extra-axial spaces outlining the left cerebral convexity, which is compatible with recent surgery. in the area of the known enhancing mass in the left parietooccipital region, a tract is seen with t1 and t2 bright material, likely representing blood products and fluid. the remainder of the examination including the vasogenic edema surroungind the lesion is unchanged.
no intracranial mass lesion, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, or acute minor or major vascular territorial infarct is apparent. mild periventricular t2 hyperintensities are consistent with sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. old lacunar infarcts are seen in the bilateral basal ganglia. there is a small retention cyst within the left sphenoid air cells. mild mucosal sinus disease is present within the maxillary sinuses bilaterally. mra of the circle of ___:
the patient is status post right temporal craniotomy. small foci of blood products are demonstrated in the surgical bed in the right temporal region. underlying subdural collection is visualized and persistent mild midline shifting towards the left, approximately 3 mm of deviation is demonstrated. no diffusion abnormalities are detected to suggest acute/subacute ischemic changes. on t2 and flair sequences, there is persistent vasogenic edema surrounding the surgical cavity and extending on the right insular region, right temporal lobe and right basal ganglia, unchanged since the prior study. after the administration of gadolinium contrast, there is persistent ependymal enhancement in the region of the right ventricular ___, the possibility of residual mass is a consideration, continued followup is recommended. the orbits are unremarkable. the paranasal sinuses demonstrate mucosal thickening on the left maxillary sinus and bilateral patchy mastoid mucosal thickening.
in comparison with the prior study dated ___, again multiple t2 and flair hyperintensity areas within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres are observed, no significant change in the distribution of these hyperintense areas is noted in the interim. these are nonspecific in origin and may represent sequelae of chronic small microvascular ischemic changes. this is a limited examination secondary to motion artifact. after the administration of gadolinium-based contrast, there is no evidence of abnormal enhancement. there are no areas of restricted diffusion. there is no shift of normally midline structures. the ventricles and sulci are prominent, likely age related and involutional in nature, unchanged since the prior examination. again the right maxillary sinus demonstrates mucosal thickening. persistent and unchanged bilateral mastoid air cell opacities. normal flow void signal is identified in the vascular structures.
the patient is status post removal of a right frontal meningioma. there is decreased surrounding edema. there is no evidence of nodular enhancment at the surgical site. the previously noted peripehral enhancement and slow diffusion is no longer appreciated on this study. there is slow diffusion in the center which may represent evolution of blood products. there is evolution of the bilateral subdural effusions which appear more hyperintense on flair images and are increased in size measuring 14 mm bilaterally, previously 12 mm bilaterally. a left-sided vestibular schwannoma is noted, unchanged compared to the prior exam. sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease are noted. no filling defect is seen. the dural venous sinuses demonstrate normal enhancement without filling defect.
post-operative changes are seen in the right parietal lobe with blood products and meningeal thickening. the hemorrhagic cavity in the right thalamus and periatrial region with possible subependymal extension to the ventricle is again noted but has decreased in size. there is continued presence of nodular enhancement surrounding the margins of the cavity suggesting residual neoplasm. the lesion currently measures 32 x 22 mm compared to prior measurements of 38 x 22 mm. mass effect on the third ventricle and the ipsilateral occipital ___ is unchanged. there is a right frontal ventriculostomy tract. the edema surrounding the lesion has decreased. no evidence for acute ischemia or hydrocephalus.
post-op changes are seen in the left temporal lobe. there appears to be slight increased enhancement in the left temporal lobe compared to the prior examination. there is edema/non-enhancing infiltrative neoplasm on the flair images which is relatively stable. previously noted post-operative cavity appears to have shrunken slightly in the interim.stable flair signal changes in the left frontal and temporal lobes. there is no evidence for hydrocephalus or acute ischemia.
there is extensive edema identified in both frontal lobes, right greater than left side. in the right frontal lobe, there is evidence of blood products of high density with an area of low intensity on mp-rage t1 images. there is intense enhancement at the margin of the cavity. this area could represent an area of hematoma with probable superimposed infection . although some enhancement could be seen at the margin of chronic hematomas, intense enhancement favors infection. there is mass effect on the right lateral ventricle with mild midline shift. there is deviation of the septum pellucidum to the left side. the diffusion images demonstrate a small linear area of slow diffusion within the corpus callosum, indicating small acute infarct within the corpus callosum. there is no hydrocephalus identified. the left dbs electrode demonstrates edema in the frontal lobe. however, no abnormal enhancement is seen in this region.
as suggested on the preceding ct scan, there are multiple dural- based metastases. the largest present overlies the right frontal lobe measuring 10 x 19 mm, as well as overlying the posterior left frontal lobe measuring 10 x 20 mm. there is an additional mass which is difficult to measure given its heterogeneity, though approximately measures 15 x 20 mm. this surrounds the right anterior clinoid process and extends along the sphenoid triangle. there is extension into the cavernous sinus on the right, surrounding the right internal carotid artery. there is a contiguous flow void within the ica. no definite extension into the masticator space is identified. there is slight asymmetric enhancement surrounding foramen ovale on the right side. additionally, there is a heterogeneous 15 x 20 mm mass within the sphenoid sinus which extends to the posterior and superior wall. it is possible there is contiguity between these two masses, though no definite connection is identified. there is extensive pneumatization of the sphenoid, both laterally as well as into the base of the sphenoid. the sinus is near completely opacified. there is near-complete opacification of the right maxillary sinus with an air-fluid level suggesting active disease, though no discrete enhancing mass is identified. there is a small 9-mm t1 hyperintense nodule associated with the right tentorial leaflet. it is difficult to discern any significant enhancement given the intrinsic t1 hyperintensity and this may simply represent calcification or blood products. no definite intraparenchymal lesions are identified. there is diffuse dural thickening and enhancement. there are several subgaleal heterogeneous masses present, the largest overlying the right frontal bone measuring 7 x 25 mm, with a smaller 11-mm mass within the subgaleal space overlying the left parietal lobe. there is heterogeneous enhancement within the nasopharynx with fluid opacifying the nasopharynx. this may be secondary to intubation. associated with this are bilateral mastoid air cell effusions. there is fullness of the pituitary gland with heterogeneous enhancement with a convex superior border, and the gland itself measuring approximately 10 mm. there is a small enhancing nodule within the subcutaneous tissues overlying the right occiput. there is an additional tiny dural-based nodule overlying the right parietal lobe near the vertex.
post-surgical changes are redemonstrated in the right parietal convexity with persistent irregular enhancement in the surgical cavity and vasogenic edema, no significant shifting of the midline structures is identified. the pattern of enhancement is irregular and apparently remains unchanged since the most recent study dated ___. at the left parietal convexity, again an oval-shaped enhancing lesion is redemonstrated, measuring approximately 12 x 10 mm in transverse dimension, likely consistent with a meningioma, there is persistent and unchanged pattern of enhancement in the adjacent sulcus (image #85, series #2). fiducial markers are in place. no other lesions are identified.
again demonstrated are two areas of enhancement within the right cerebral hemisphere. the lesion within the right frontal lobe adjacent to the lateral ventrical is unchanged in size and appearance from the prior study. the surrounding vasogenic edema does not appear significantly changed. the enhancing lesion within the right temporal lobe is smaller with less surrounding edema. tiny regions of susceptibility artifact are unchanged within these lesions. there is no significant mass effect, shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus. there are no new areas of enhancment demonstrated. the major vascular flow patterns are normal. the surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are unchanged in appearance.
a punctate area of slow diffusion is noted in right medial temporal lobe medial to the temporal ___ of right lateral ventricle. it appears hypointense on adc maps and likely represents a small area of ischemia. the ___-white matter differentiation is maintained. the cortical sulci, ventricles and extra-axial csf spaces appear normal. brainstem and cerebellum appear normal. there is mucosal thickening noted in bilateral ethmoid air cells. fluid is noted in the right mastoid air cells. post-operative status is noted of the left mastoid.

the left-sided convexity parafalcine and supratentorial subdural hematoma is again noted essentially the same as on the prior examination. there is also a small right parafalcine subdural and a small right occipital supratentorial subdural. on sagittal images there is also subdural hematoma on the posterior aspect of the clivus displacing the brain stem slightly. there is no evidence of abnormal signal within the underlying brain stem. there is no evidence of restricted diffusion to suggest the presence of acute infarction of brain. ventricles remain moderately enlarged.
there is redemonstration of two adjacent superficial hematomas involving the left frontal lboe and insula, with mild surrounding edema. there are also small foci of low signal on gradient echo images in the left parietal and posterior temporal parenchyma, indicating additional microhemorrhages. of note, all of these hemorrhages are located in the left middle cerebral artery (mca) territory. no microhemorrhages are seen in other portions of the brain. this distribution raises the possibility of a hemorrhagic transformation of a left mca infarct. however, the small amount of edema surrounding the larger hemorrhages is more congruent with edema secondary to the hemorrhages, rather than an underlying infarct. diffusion-weighted images demonstrate signal abnormalities corresponding to the foci of blood due to the distortion of the magnetic field. there appears to be a thin rim of low signal on the adc map surrounding the larger hemorrhages, but this could also be an artifact of magnetic field distortion, rather than truly slowed diffusion. no slowed diffusion is seen remote to the blood products to definitively suggest an acute infarct. postcontrast images demonstrate linear enhancement along the larger hemorrhages, as well as patchy enhancement within the larger hemorrhages. on gradient echo images, there is low signal in the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles, indicating blood products. there is age-appropriate ventricular prominence. the right internal carotid artery flow void is absent, as this vessel is shown to be occluded on the prior cta, as well as on the ___ cta.
this is a limited examination due to multiple motion artifacts. there is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass, mass effect, or shifting of the normally midline structures. the ventricles and sulci are prominent, likely indicating volume loss, possibly age related and involutional in nature. the t2 and flair sequences demonstrate multiple scattered areas of high signal intensity, distributed in the subcortical and periventricular white matter, which are nonspecific and may represent chronic microvascular ischemic disease. normal flow void signal is noted at the major vascular structures. the orbits, the paranasal sinuses and the mastoid air cells are grossly unremarkable.

accounting for differences in slice selection and angulation, there has been interval increase in thick nodular enhancement surrounding the right frontal resection cavity site, with the most dominant nodular enhancement in the left posteromedial aspect measuring 1.3 x 0.9 cm. there has been interval increase in progression and extension of enhancement which now crosses completely the corpus callosum and enters into the medial left frontal lobe. there is also increased nodular enhancement along the corpus callosum posteriorly as well as slightly into the lateral aspect of the body of the right lateral ventricle. there is restricted diffusion corresponding to the region of enhancement reflecting high grade ___. the flair signal abnormality is unchanged when compared to the prior exam and measures a volume of 167.17 cm2. the volume of enhancement measures 17.36 cm2. there is a stable appearance to the right frontal craniotomy site with a stable subdural fluid collection. there is stable high t2/flair signal within the bilateral frontal lobes with extension posteriorly into the parietooccipital and right temporal subcortical white matter, likely reflecting post-radiation changes. there is a stable mucus retention cyst in the right maxillary antrum. otherwise, the remainder of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. the orbital structures are stable. there is flattening of the pituitary gland within a normal-sized sella, likely representing partial empty sella syndrome.

the enhancing focus in the head of the left caudate nucleus has increased from previously 1.4 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm to currently 1.8 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm. the right frontal lobe resection cavity is unchanged with adjacent cystic changes, with mild enhancement of the margins and right frontal encephalomalacia with ex vacuo dilatation of the frontal and right lateral ventricle. again seen is susceptibility artifact in the frontal lobe at the resection site consistent with post-surgical ___ products or metallic artifact from prior surgery. there are no diffusion abnormalities identified. unchanged mucosal thickening and fluid in the right side of the sphenoid sinus.
as demonstrated on the head ct, multiple rim enhancing lesions with surrounding edema are identified in both cerebral hemispheres involving the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes with mild involvement of both occipital lobes and posterior fossa involving both cerebellar hemispheres. there is no evidence of effacement of the ventricles nor is there evidence of midline shift. there is no evidence of hydrocephalus. the evaluation for leptomeningeal metastases is slightly limited due to motion on the post gadolinium images. however, both on axial and coronal images, no evidence of definite abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement is seen to indicate leptomeningeal involvement. soft tissue changes due to mucosal thickening are identified in the sphenoid sinus.
an area of enhancement is again visualized in the right frontal lobe just superior to the right lateral ventricle. there appears to be increased central enhancement than previously seen. however, in the diffusion-weighted imaging sequence, the area shows increased fast diffusion, which could be related to treatment-related necrosis. there is surrounding vasogenic edema, which is not significantly changed. the tiny regions of susceptibility related changes are also stable. there is no significant mass effect, shift in the midline structures, or hydrocephalus. no new areas of enhancement are present. the major vascular flow patterns are normal. the surrounding soft tissue and osseous structures are unremarkable.

there is evidence of slow diffusion along the cortical sulci of the right frontal and parietal lobes involving the motor cortex and supplemental motor area with associated increased t2 signal. foci of increased dwi signal in the left precentral gyrus and left parietal lobe may represent additional foci of ischemic involvement or artifact. there are patchy areas of periventricular increased flair signal, which are nonspecific. there is no definite associated flair signal abnormality. there is no evidence of hemorrhage. susceptibility artifact along the anterior falx corresponds to calcifications on the prior ct. there is evidence of basal ganglia mineralization. there is mucosal thickening involving the left maxillary sinus and the ethmoid air cells, as well as increased fluid signal within the mastoids bilaterally. there is mucosal thickening in the sphenoid sinuses. the remaining visualized paranasal sinuses and orbits are unremarkable.

there is diffuse brain edema involving the cortex, particularly in the insular regions. there is no intracranial mass lesion, hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures. high t1 signal in the basal ganglia regions may be a manifestation of hepatic failure preceding the recent transplants, as opposed to effects of recent perfusion deficiency. there is fluid and/or mucosal thickening in the mastoid air cells bilaterally. the major vascular flow patterns are normal.
there is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect, or infarction. a few scattered foci of t2 hyperintensity in the periventricular and subcortical white matter are unchanged, most compatible with chronic small vessel ischemic disease. no diffusion abnormalities are detected. there is no abnormal enhancement after contrast administration.

there is diffuse meningeal enhancement overlying the right cerebral hemisphere. superiorly, there appears to be increased fluid in the subdural space overlying the right frontal and right parietal regions. it is difficult to characterize the subdural collection, but it has increased t1 and t2 signal components, as well as internal susceptibility which suggests hemorrhage. in part, however, this may be a proteiaceous collection, and therefore could be a subdural empyema. the region also diffusely enhances. right mastoid air cells remain filled with fluid; there are scattered fluid- filled mastoid air cells on the left, and the frontal sinuses. bilateral maxillary sinus, ethmoid sinus, and sphenoid sinus mucosal thickening has improved. no abnormal signal intensity is seen within the brain parenchyma. the brain appears structurally normal. major arterial and venous flow voids are grossly normal.
since most recent examination, there are now multiple small foci of precontrast increased t1 intensity lesions along the subcortical and deep white matter, predominantly within the prefrontal region bilaterally adjacent to the primary motor cortex and within the anterior superior right frontal lobe. these areas display evidence of restricted diffusion, with some displaying low signal on the adc map. minimal flair abnormality is noted within these lesions. post- contrast images display diffuse enhancing lesions most prominent within the superior frontal lobes bilaterally with probable leptomeningeal involvement. when compared to most recent examination, the size, ring enhancement, and total number of enhancing lesions is decreased. a minimal amount of rightward subfalcine herniation persists; otherwise, there is no other evidence of significant mass effect or hydrocephalus. small punctate region of susceptibility artifact within the right frontal lobe, likely from prior biopsy is stable, with no new areas of susceptibility artifact are identified. diffuse vasogenic edema within the cerebral peduncles and frontal lobes persists and does not appear significantly changed.
there is focal t2 signal hyperintensity in the left subinsular white matter and anterior limb of the left internal capsule, likely due to chronic microvascular infarction. the ventricles are enlarged for the patient's age of 63 years, out of proportion to sulcal size. there is no evidence of transependymal csf flow. there is no edema or mass effect. there is no slow diffusion to suggest acute ischemia. following administration of intravenous gadolinium, there is no evidence of abnormal enhancement. there is mucosal thickening with probable mucus retention cysts in both maxillary sinuses, the sphenoid sinuses, frontal sinuses, and opacification of multiple bilateral ethmoid air cells, without fluid levels to suggest acute sinusitis. there is opacification of the mastoid air cells bilaterally. fluid is also noted in the nasopharynx, a nonspecific finding.
the previously noted left temporal lesion, with heterogeneous enhancement inferiorly and predominantly cystic portion superiorly with significant mass effect on the left lateral ventricle and mild rightward shift of the midline structures, with the cystic component measuring approximately 3.9 x 3.3 cm is redemonstrated for surgical planning. part of the lesion is in close proximity to the left middle cerebral artery. there is increased signal intensity in the left mastoid air cells from fluid and mucosal thickening as before. study somewhat limited due to patient motion-related artifacts.
right frontal craniotomy is again noted and unchanged. in comparison with the most recent examination, dated ___, there has been interval increase in size of the previously demonstrated lesions involving the left frontal lobe. the most anterior lesion measures approximately 15.9 x 14.5 mm in transverse dimension x 15.2 x 13.3 mm in the coronal projection, previously this lesion measures 9.5 x 13.3 mm in transverse dimension x 10.9 x 8.6 mm in coronal projection. there is also increase in the pattern of vasogenic edema. please compare the image #18, series #4 from the current examination with the prior study image 19, series #10. no new lesions are identified in the interval. there is no evidence of hydrocephalus or significant shifting of the normally midline structures. no diffusion abnormalities are detected to suggest acute/subacute ischemic changes. the flow void signal in the major vascular structures appears maintained. the orbits, the paranasal sinuses, and the mastoid air cells are grossly unremarkable.
the right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema and minimal contralateral shift has not significantly changed in appearance. the intraventricular hemorrhage in the occipital ___ of the bilateral lateral ventricles is also unchanged. there is curvilinear focus of slow diffusion in a cortical distribution in the right parietal lobe consistent with acute infarct. in addition, there are foci of susceptibility over the cerebellar convexities, consistent with subarachnoid hemorrhage. there are extensive confluent foci of high signal intensity in the periventricular and deep white matter as well as the brainstem consistent with sequelae of microvascular ischemia. the ventricles are dilated and there is generalized brain parenchymal atrophy. the paranasal sinuses are clear. there is no abnormal marrow signal.
there is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or vascular territorial infarction. ventricles and sulci are normal in size and in configuration. flair images reveal a nonspecific focus of flair hyperintensity in the periventricular white matter of the parietal lobe on the right, a finding which appears unchanged. there is no abnormal focus of enhancement, specifically no evidence of optic neuritis, though a dedicated mr of that region may be more sensitive. paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. incidental note is made of a partially empty sella turcica.
on flair images, in the previously noted region of left frontal lobe abnormality, hyperintensity is noted within multiple sulci, with subjacent edematous changes including sulcal effacement and blurring of the ___-white matter junction. this signal abnormality is seen extending inferiorly through the sylvian fissure and into the left suprasellar and interpeduncular cisterns (5:10). there is an equivocal trace hyperintensity in the dependent portion of the left occipital ___ (5:11). a focal region of hyperintensity is also noted in the deep right post-central sulcus (5:14). there is some associated diffusion restriction, with mild increased dwi signal and decreased adc signal. no corresponding abnormalities are noted on t1, t2, and t2* sequences. in addition, there is no significant lesion enhancement following intravenous gadolinium contrast administration. these findings contrast to the prior ct findings of mild contrast enhancement, gadolinium localizes to the extracellular compartment following cell membrane injury. therefore, ct related enhancement may indicate reactive hyperemia without abnormal vascularity. the findings described above are nonspecific in both imaging appearance and location: - flair sulcal hyperintensity has been described in a number of conditions, including proteinaceous fluid, hemorrhage, infection/inflammation, malignancy, stroke/vascular abnormalities, and hyperoxygenation/propofol exposure. - restricted diffusion can be seen with proteinaceous fluid, hemorrhage, certain types of inflammation, hyperdense or necrotic malignancies, acute infarction, and drug intoxications. evaluating these various possibilities, no abnormal t1/t2 signal or t2* blooming artifact are noted, making this lesion atypical for most forms of hemorrhage. there is no significant lesional enhancement, as is normally seen in infectious, inflammatory, and malignant processes. the lesions are bilateral, and not in a major vascular distribution to support acute infarction. oxygen injury is generally associated with more diffuse, symmetric bilateral lesions. the remainder of the brain parenchyma appears unremarkable. there are no intracranial mass lesions. the intracranial arteries and venous sinuses are well opacified with contrast, and appear patent throughout their courses. normal flow voids are seen in the major vessels on non-contrast images. the ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration, without shift of the normal midline structures. there is no uncal herniation, and the previously described density in the left suprasellar cistern corresponds to the region of flair hyperintensity described above. the patient is intubated. again seen is extensive mucosal thickening and fluid opacification of all paranasal sinuses, as well as the mastoid air cells. there are no soft tissue abnormalities. the orbits, maxillary teeth, and skull base appear unremarkable.

in the sulci about the left frontal lobe, there is high-signal blood, which corresponds to the subarachnoid blood seen on the prior head cts dated ___, and ___. there also is increased t2 signal in the occipital lobe white matter bilaterally. this abnormality corresponds to the regions of low attenuation seen on the prior head ct dated ___, and is consistent with changes from posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome (pres syndrome). there is no mass effect or shift of the normal midline structures. there is no evidence of an intraaxial or extraaxial mass. in the mra: we do see an abnormality of the arteries in the circle of ___. however, at the level of the c1 vertebral body in the neck, there is a small focal dissection of the right internal carotid artery. this abnormality is stable when compared to a cta dated ___.
again, note is made of somewhat hyperintense csf bilaterally in the sulcal subarachnoid space, which is somewhat less prominent compared to the prior study, likely representing abnormal csf related to known meningitis. no definite leptomeningeal enhancement is noted. there is focal flair- hyperintensity in the left occipital lobe surrounded by edema, with corresponding restricted diffusion, persistent since prior study. the appearance and the persistence of the abnormal diffusion signal are somewhat atypical for infarction, and the finding is worrisome for another process, such as cerebritis or early abscess formation. again demonstrated is unusual very small focus of restricted diffusion, apparently located in the most posterior portion of left occipital ___ (or subependyma), persistent since ___. the previously mentioned lesion in left occipital lobe may be continuous to this abnormal signal in left occipital ___, which is likely due to the same process. no other focus of restricted diffusion is identified. there is hyperintense signal within bilateral ethmoid sinuses, increased compared to the prior study, representing sinusitis. there is hyperintense polyp versus mucus retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus. extensive opacification of bilateral mastoid air cells is unchanged, representing mastoiditis.

there is no acute infarct identified. there is a left-sided subdural collection identified from frontal to the occipital region with densities on t1-weighted images slightly higher than the csf indicative of a chronic subdural hematoma. overall, the size of the subdural hematoma has not significantly changed since the previous study. there is obliteration of the adjacent sulci seen without midline shift. there is pachymeningeal enhancement identified in the left middle cranial fossa and along the left temporal region which is unchanged from previous study and could be likely associated with the subdural hematoma. there is no evidence of acute infarct seen or enhancing brain lesions identified. extensive soft tissue changes are seen in the sphenoid, frontal, ethmoid sinuses and mastoid air cells, which could be related to intubation. there is no definite leptomeningeal enhancement identified. there is no hydrocephalus. cavum septum pellucidum and vergae are again noted as an incidental finding. the vascular flow voids are maintained.

the study is compared with the concurrent nect, as well as the most recent enhanced mr examination, including tumor volumetry, dated ___; the comparison is rendered more difficult due to the difference in post-contrast imaging (spin-echo versus gradient-echo technique), as well as the difference in imaging unit. however, there is now more extensive confluent vasogenic edema, extending via white matter tracts in the left corona radiata to reach the centrum semiovale. there is also small amount of edema along the left transfrontal presumed biopsy tract, new since the previous study. there is now also more extensive edema throughout the left frontal lobe, as well as the inferior aspect of that temporal lobe, extending along the optic radiations to reach the left occipital pole and involving the left lateral aspect of the splenium of the corpus callosum. the edema is centered on the conglomerate rim-enhancing masses along the inferomedial aspect of the left temporal lobe, including that hippocampal formation, which are difficult both to measure and to compare, given the irregularity and incompleteness of the rim enhancement (at least with present technique), as well as their confluence. the most-anterior mass measures roughly 2.9 cm trv, equivocally slightly larger allowing for differences in sequence, as well as slide selection and angulation, since the earlier study. the immediately dorsal component, adjacent to the left cerebral peduncle, measures roughly 2.4 x 1.0 cm and may actually be smaller in maximal transverse dimension, but, with the increased edema, exerts more mass effect upon the ipsilateral cerebral peduncle. finally, the satellite nodule, located dorsal to the dominant enhancing lesion(s), measures 9.5 mm, not significantly changed over the interval. there is roughly 5 mm rightward shift of the septum pellucidum, slightly worse since the previous study, when it measured 3.5 mm. the remainder of the examination is not much changed. there are punctate foci of apparent "blooming" susceptibility artifact centered in the tumor mass, not clearly present previously, which likely relate to the interval biopsy; there is no evidence of hemorrhage elsewhere. there is no focus of restricted diffusion. no pathologic subependymal or leptomeningeal enhancement is identified.

there has been expected maturation of the left mca territory infarction involving the left frontal, parietal, and lesser extent, the anterior temporal cortex, and extending into the basal ganglia and lateral thalamus. the left mca flow void is preserved on the axial t2-weighted sequences. foci of blooming within the anterior cortical portion of the infarct and within the left putamen are compatible with hemorrhagic transformation. there is no significant midline shift. there continues to be effacement of the left lateral ventricle secondary to mass effect from the extensive cytotoxic edema.
there is slow diffusion in the posterior inferior left cerebellar hemisphere and in the left lateral medulla, consistent with a large acute infarction in the posterior inferior cerebellar artery territory. the abnormal diffusion signal extends inferiorly to the craniocervical junction and the imaged upper cervical cord, with bilateral involvement. a large portion of the infarcted left cerebellar hemisphere demonstrates extensive blood products, consistent with hemorrhagic transformation. associated swelling results in severe compression of the fourth ventricle. the third and lateral ventricles are normal in size at this time. the left posterolateral pons is deformed from the mass effect. there is contrast enhancement along the margins of the infarcted territory, including along numerous cerebellar folia, which may be seen in subacute infarctions. however, malignant involvement is difficult to exclude, given the clinical setting. there is an 8 x 7 mm rim-enhancing leptomeningeal nodule in the inferior left parietal lobe (images 102:65 and 103:85), likely a metastasis. there is no edema in the adjacent brain parenchyma. there is a large expansile mass infiltrating the clivus, the petrous left temporal bone, and the left occipital bone, extending to the right occipital bone in the midline. this was seen on the prior non-contrast ct scans. inferiorly, the mass involves the c1 vertebral body, where it encases the left vertebral artery. the mass abuts the left parotid canal, foramen lacerum, and foramen ovale. the mass invades most of the left mastoid. few preserved left mastoid air cells are opacified. right mastoid air cells are opacified. there is fluid throughout the paranasal sinuses. these findings may be related to endotracheal intubation and/or prolonged supine positioning.

as before, note is made of an extra-axial, avidly enhancing mass, consistent with a meningioma measuring 2.4 x 1.7 x 1.6 cm (series 4ak, image 43), minimally changed from the most recent measurements of 2.4 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm. there is no new area of enhancement. as before, there is cystic encephalomalacia in the right frontal lobe that is unchanged, as is ex vacuo dilation of the frontal ___ of the right lateral ventricle. pre-contrast t1-weighted images demonstrate a gyriform pattern t1-weighted signal hyperintensity, similar to the prior exam. hyperintense signal on the t2-weighted trace from the diffusion weighted images is without corresponding hypointensity on the apparent diffusion coefficient maps, and is at least partially attributable to hyperintense flair/t2-weighted signal. as before, there is no intracranial hemorrhage. principal intracranial flow voids are normal. mastoid air cells are clear.
patient is status post right-sided craniotomy at the vertex. no focus of abnormal enhancement is noted in the surgical bed to suggest recurrent tumor. the ventricles and extra-axial csf spaces are normal. a small focus of negative susceptibility in the left temporal lobe is unchanged and may represent a small focus of microhemorrhage or calcification. the visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses and the mastoid air cells are clear. the major intracranial arterial flow voids are noted.

the left frontal enhancing mass, which has a relatively hypointense center with foci of nodular enhancement, has increased in size since the ___ mri. whereas this mass was previously measured as roughly 8 mm in transverse dimension, it is now about 2.4 cm. there is a fine rim of enhancement around the surgical defect in the left parietal lobe. this is similar in configuration to the surgical bed observed on the postoperative exam of ___. no additional enhancing masses are identified, though there is limited evaluation of the superior aspect of the brain due to wraparound artifact.
along the anterior falx cerebri, a lobulated, enhancing mass (with reference to the outside hospital mri pre-contrast sequences) impinges upon the anterior, inferior and medial aspects of both frontal lobes, with extensive associated vasogenic edema. the mass is closely adherent to the dural surface and is presumed extra-axial. there is mass effect on the frontal lobes, particularly compressing the gyrus rectus. assessment of the adjacent paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity, in conjunction with images from the outside hospital ct, indicate that the mass is confined to the intracranial space and does not invade the nasal cavity or paranasal sinus. while the mass appears well circumscribed, adjacent vessels in the brain parenchyma appear dilated. adjacent gyri are effaced. there is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, other enhancing mass, or other area of edema or mass effect. the ventricles are prominent for the patient's age, in a configuration suggesting congenital etiology, given the relative prominence of the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles in particular. the intracranial vessels and their major branches enhance normally. moderate paranasal sinus disease is present, with mucosal thickening involving the frontal and ethmoid air cells.
the immediate postoperative changes seen on the prior study have resolved. there is a residual signal abnormality and gliosis in the right parietal lobe which likely represents some combination of post-treatment changes and residual neoplasm. no progression is seen. no enhancement is noted. there is no evidence for acute ischemia or hydrocephalus.
there are multiple areas of flair signal abnormality seen in bilateral posterior parietal and occipital lobes with corresponding restricted diffusion. post-contrast scans reveal gyriform pattern of enhancement. there is no abnormal susceptibility to suggest hemorrhagic changes. on the pre-contrast t1-weighted images, there is high signal in a gyriform pattern. flair signal abnormalities are also seen in bilateral frontal white matter and along few of the right frontal sulci, series 7, image 13 and 14. the areas of signal abnormality in the high frontal lobes do not show restricted diffusion or enhancement. ventricles and sulci are normal in size and contour. there is mild mucosal thickening involving bilateral maxillary and ethmoid sinuses. visualized orbits are unremarkable. there is some fluid signal in the left mastoid air cells. major intracranial flow voids are normal.
redemonstrated is the known right thalamic mass with extension into the right lateral ventricle and the rostral portion of the right cerebral peduncle. the mass is heterogeneously enhancing with a necrotic center and contains small amount of blood products, most pronounced in the upper portion of the mass. the mass is overall about unchanged in size and has slightly collapsed centrally. however, there is new subtle enhancement along a previous right parietal approach biopsy tract (se 11a, 80). there is diffuse right greater than left periventricular vasogenic edema which is likely sequela from previous radiation treatment. there is unchanged thickening of the right mid temporal lobe cortex (series 4, image 10). a right ventriculostomy catheter ends at the foramen of ___, with interval decrease of the now normally sized ventricular system. there is new uniform, diffuse, dural thickening and pachymeningeal enhancement (series 12, image 15 and series 11a, image 74). this is likely due to reduction in the ventricular caliber. there are no diffusion abnormalities. there is chronic mucosal thickening and loss of volume of the right maxillary sinus consistent with chronic paranasal sinus disease. the remainder of paranasal sinuses and the orbits as well as the cerebellar pontine angles are normal. there is no evidence of intracranial herniation. the partially visualized upper cervical spine as well as the intracranial arterial and venous system are normal. there are no suspicious bony lesions.
there is a right frontal resection cavity. contrast enhancement along the cavity margins appears stable on the axial and sagittal postcontrast images, but larger on the coronal postcontrast images. high t2 signal surrounding the cavity is stable in extent. single-voxel mr ___ was obtained in 3 different areas of the contrast enhancement, demonstrating elevated choline peaks, decreased naa peaks, and reversed choline/naa ratios in all three spectra. there is no evidence of hyperperfusion on the asl sequence. the dsc perfusion study was technically unsuccessful. the enhancing lesion along the left sylvian fissure, and associated high t2 signal, are stable in extent. there is an enhancing focus in the right inferior temporal lobe, seen on the coronal postcontrast sequence only (series 13, image 19) and not corroborated on the axial or sagittal images. there is no evidence of associated high t2 signal on the axial flair images, although this area is poorly evaluated in the axial plane. confluent t2 hyperintensities in the supratentorial white matter, which likely represent chronic small vessel disease, are unchanged. there is no diffusion abnormality. there is fluid and mucosal thickening of in the left maxillary sinus.
there is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect, or infarction. the ventricles are prominent bilaterally and the sulci are prominent bilaterally in a fashion that is greater than expected for age- related changes in a 66-year-old female. the prominence of the bilateral ventricles is suggestive of possible normal pressure hydrocephalus. please correlate clinically with symptoms. there are also noted to be significant periventricular white matter changes that is again greater than expected for a 66-year-old female. these findings are consistent with small vessel chronic ischemic changes. there is also noted to be bilateral fluid within the mastoids consistent with possible mastoiditis. there are no diffusion abnormalities detected. there is no abnormal enhancement after contrast administration.
the study is compared with very recent cranial mri and mra of ___. the dwi sequence is notable for a dominant focus of restricted diffusion at the lateral aspect of the right thalamus, likely also involving the medial aspect of the posterior limb of that internal capsule with corresponding hypointensity on the adc map and early flair-hyperintensity suggesting that this is of at least six hours duration. also demonstrated is an additional punctate focus in the right parieto-occipital subcortical white matter (10:16) with corresponding adc-hypointensity (9,10:16), also likely relatively acute. an only moderate-signal focus in the corresponding contralateral parietooccipital region demonstrates no definitive adc map correlate and likely does not represent an acute ischemic event. however, there is a curvilinear focus of slightly-less hyperintense diffusion abnormality involving the left paramedian pons with corresponding adc-hypointensity (9,10:7) and minimal corresponding flair-hyperintensity, also new and likely representing a late acute or early subacute left paramedian pontine infarct. no other finding of acute infarction is seen, there is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage and the principal intracranial vascular flow-voids are preserved. again demonstrated is relatively severe both punctate and confluent t2-hyperintensity in periventricular and subcortical white matter, representing chronic microvascular infarction. there is normal flow-related enhancement in the included intracranial portions of both internal carotid and proximal middle and anterior cerebral arteries, with an overall appearance not significantly changed since the recent study. again demonstrated is relatively mild irregularity with segmental narrowing of, particularly, the distal branches of the inferior division of the left mca, distal to its bifurcation, not significantly changed over the short-interval. the more proximal portions of these vessels, as well as the remaining vessels of the circle of ___ demonstrate relatively preserved flow-related enhancement, with no new flow-limiting stenosis or mural irregularity. the imaging of the cervical vessels was limited to the 2d-tof technique, which demonstrates these vessels only from approximately the level of the thyroid gland through the skull base. however, these segments of both the carotid and the vertebral arteries, bilaterally, demonstrate normal caliber, contour, and flow-related enhancement, without significant mural irregularity or flow-limiting stenosis.
since the previous study, the patient has undergone resection of the large frontal lobe mass. large surgical cavity with blood products and pneumocephalus identified. there are blood products with t1 hyperintensities at the margin. brain edema is also noted. there is subfalcine herniation and midline shift, with mass effect on the right lateral ventricle. following gadolinium administration, there is dural enhancement identified along the frontal and interhemispheric region. accounting for blood products at the margin of the surgical cavity which are t1 hyperintense, some residual enhancement is identified at the posterior superior margin of the surgical cavity as well as the lateral margin in the lower frontal region. no definite nodular enhancement is identified. there is no evidence of acute infarct seen, although subtle hyperintensities at the margin of surgical cavity indicate postoperative changes on diffusion images.

some of the previously noted foci of high signal on t2-weighted and flair images in the frontal and occipital sulci are resolved, and others appear less prominent. leptomeningeal blood vessels appear more prominent on gadolinium-enhanced images, which may be related to the fact that the current study was performed on a 3 tesla mri scanner, and the previous study was performed on a 1.5 tesla mri scanner. there is no evidence of abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement. however, there is increased pachymeningeal (dural) enhancement, which may represent spread of infection, tumor, or result of lumbar puncture. (presence of increased pachymeningeal enhancement is likely not related to differences in the mri scanner between the current and the previous study.) a developmental venous anomaly is again noted in the left frontal lobe. the ventricles are stable in size. the visualized extracranial structures appear unremarkable.

the study is compared with recent enhanced mr examination of ___, as well as nect of ___. as before, the patient is status post right frontal craniotomy with expected post-surgical changes at the site. there is a persistent rounded 0.5 mm (ap) intrinsically t1-hyperintense focus at the site of previous hematoma with more tubular intrinsic t1-hyperintensity, anteromedially (4:14-15). however, allowing for this, there is a robust enhancement, measuring up to 19 (ap) x 13 mm (trv). however, on the mp-rage sequence, this dominant focus appears to demonstrate only rim enhancement and may simply represent evolving blood products. in contrast, the more anterior focus demonstrates definitive enhancement and measures up to 10 mm (trv) x 7 mm (cc) [1001:51]; this very likely represents residual tumor at this site. no similar focus is identified elsewhere on either post-contrast acquisition. overall, the associated vasogenic edema is significantly improved since the most recent examination. there is expected focal pachymeningeal enhancement at the resection bed with a thin lentiform extra-axial collection at the operative site, overlying the right frontal ___ measuring 8 mm in maximal thickness and containing numerous small air bubbles.

the patient is status post left suboccipital craniectomy for meningioma resection. there has been interval resolution of postsurgical hemorrhage. a 21 x 8 x 10 mm enhancing focus adjacent to the left transverse sinus (6:8, 10:85) likely represents the focus of residual tumor seen previously, as noted in the operative report. this has minimally increased in size compared to prior, allowing for differences in plane of scanning, and demonstrates intermediate to slightly hyperintense signal on diffusion weighted sequence; given the initial properties of the tumor, these features continue to raise suspicion for residual tumor. there is no evidence for acute hemorrhage, mass, shift of normally midline structures, or infarct. no diffusion abnormality is detected. the ventricles and sulci are normal in caliber and configuration. note is made of hyperostosis frontalis. mild mucosal thickening in the left maxillary sinus and a small amount of fluid in the left mastoid air cells are seen.

a 6.7 x 3.7 mm focus of increased t1 and decreased t2 signal intensity is identified adjacent to the right lateral ventricle. this focus demonstrates susceptibility artifact, consistent with a small parenchymal hemorrhage. given the premature age of the patient and location, this likely represents a small subacute germinal matrix hemorrhage. there is no extension into the lateral ventricles, evidence of mass effect or hydrocephalus. no other signal abnormalities are identified within the brain. the ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are age-appropriate. there are no areas of slow diffusion to indicate acute brain ischemia. the expected flow voids of the basal cisterns appear unremarkable.

post-surgical changes are again noted in the left temporal region. prominent perivascular spaces are noted in the hippocampi and diffusely in the corona radiata on both sides extending into the centrum semiovale. hyperintense t2 ___ signal is noted in the left insular cortex extending to the left temporal lobe, periventricular and subcortical in the frontal and the parietal lobes, right temporal, right cerebellum and pons without significant enhancement. no significant change since the prior exam. there is no focus of decreased diffusion. no obvious new lesions are noted. fluid in the left mastoid air cells, otherwise the visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses and the right mastoid air cells are well aerated. the major intracranial arterial flow voids are noted.
the study was available for review on ___. new large area of increased signal intensity is noted in the left mca territory involving the left temporal lobe. this area has restricted diffusion on the diffusion-weighted images consistent with acute infarct. again noted is a large right mca territory subacute infarct with small areas of hemorrhage and restricted diffusion, which could be due to unlysed blood. the ventricles and the extra-axial csf spaces are unremarkable. persistent chronic microvessel disease with small foci of increased signal intensity on the flair images in bilateral cerebral white matter, unchanged. the osseous and the soft tissue structures and the visualized portions of the sinuses are unremarkable. however, this study is significantly limited due to motion artifacts.
within the right parietotemporal lobe is a postoperative cavity, the size of which appears somewhat smaller than on the prior examination. the degree of enhancement around the postoperative cavity, however, is more prominent on this examination compared to the prior studies, with thicker more nodular enhancement, especially along the anterior margin of the resection cavity (12:73). there is increased flair-signal abnormality around the surgical cavity measuring 7 cm in ap dimension, previously 5 cm. in this region of increased flair signal abnormality, there is no convincing focus of slow diffusion. there is some restricted diffusion, however, around the resection cavity, but this is not within the expanded area of flair abnormality and appears similar to the prior studies. no other new areas of enhancement or edema are present. the right fronal extra-axial fluid collection has decreased in size. the size and configuration of the ventricles appears unchanged with slight prominence of the ventricles and the sulci. principal vascular flow-voids appear normal. minimal mucosal thickening is seen within the ethmoid air cells bilaterally. remaining paranasal sinuses appear normal.
the patient is status post bifrontal craniectomy. a small focal susceptibility artifact at the a2 segment corresponds to the location of the aneurysmal coil (image 7:86). in the post-contrast mp-rage images, there is a corresponding focal hyperintensity outpouching from the a2 segment, grossly resembling the pre-coiled appearance of the a2 aneurysm (image 103:1), raising a high concern for recanalization. there are also multifocal narrowing of the intracranial vessels, namely at the right internal carotid, bilateral a2 segments (left worse than right), the right a1 origin, and bilateral mca (left worse than right) concerning for vasospasm. moderate parenchymal defects and signal abnormalities in the body and splenium of the corpus callosum represent the evolving subacute corpus callosal infarct. focal t1- and t2- hyperintensity in the parasagittal right frontal region represents site of subacute hemorrhage. the ventricles and sulci are not dilated and there is no midline shift. the ___-white matter differentiation is overall preserved.
this study is severely limited in interpretation secondary to patient motion. bilateral white matter periventricular flair hyperintensity is unchanged since ___ and likely a sequela of previous radiation. there is no intracranial hemorrhage, or infarction. the ventricles and sulci appear normal in size and configuration. small amount of t2 hyperintensity is seen in the mastoid air cells bilaterally and the visualized paranasal sinuses are notable for a small amount of maxillary sinus fluid bilaterally. post-contrast images are severely limited in interpretation due to patient motion artifact. enhancement seen layering along the sulci diffusely may represent normal vasculature or possible leptomeningeal spread of neoplastic disease.
within the right occipital lobe is a 2.3 x 1.7 x 1.3 t1 hyperintense intraparenchymal hemorrhage, slightly decreased compared to ___ when it measured 2.6 x 1.7 x 1.5 cm. however, slightly more vasogenic edema is associated with this lesion. no enhancement is associated with this lesion and new foci of hemorrhage are seen. again within the atrium of the left lateral ventricle, is a 1 cm irregular enhancing solid and cystic structure which demonstrates a small amount of blooming and extension into the adjacent periventricular white matter, not significantly changed compared to ___. a small amount of periventricular flair hyperintensity may represent small vessel ischemic change, though this is a nonspecific finding. mucosal thickening and fluid in the sphenoid sinus and frontal sinus has improved.
comparison with ___ and brain mri. the previously identified enhancing focus within the left parietal lobe is less well seen on today's exam, though still present. additionally, a tiny enhancing focus within the left cerebellar hemisphere is also apparent, though less obvious than on the previous study. also identified on today's study is subtle enhancement along the left internal auditory canal. there is also possible right internal auditory canal enhancement as well. in retrospect, these foci were present on the last examination, and appear slightly decreased in the interval. other findings, such as t2 and flair hyperintense foci in the corona radiata of both hemispheres, are unchanged. there is no hydrocephalus. in the interval, a ventricular drain has been placed from the right frontal lobe, traversing the right frontal ___, and terminating in the third ventricle. a subcutaneous reservoir drain is seen attached to this.
diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of acute infarct. there are multiple foci of t2 hyperintensity in the white matter and indicate moderate changes of small vessel disease. there is no abnormal parenchymal, vascular or meningeal enhancement seen.
the patient is status post resection of large right frontal lobe lesion that extended to the right thalamus and right medial temporal lobe. there is now expected post- surgical blood in resection bed, this area measures 16 x 21 mm in the transverse and ap planes. there is an enhancing rim at the surgical resection bed measuring up to 29 mm x 48 mm in the transverse and ap dimensions post- contrast administration. this finding is nonspecific post-surgery and may represent post-surgical changes or more likely may represent unresected borders of the resected mass. recommend close long-term followup. there is persistent vasogenic edema associated with the resected mass. there is associated mass effect with effacement of sulci and of the right lateral ventricle. there are areas of pneumocephalus consistent with expected postoperative changes. the patient is status post right parietotemporal craniotomy. there is no evidence of acute infarction with no diffusion abnormalities detected outside of the post- surgical bed.
mixed signal lesion within the right pons, cerebella peduncles, and posterior fossa consistent with the patient's known posterior fossa hemorrhage is again seen similar in size and distribution compared to the ct scan of ___. expected abnormal signal on diffusion-weighted images in this region of hematoma is seen with no other areas of abnormal diffusion signal to suggest acute infarction. a left-sided ventricular drain is in place with evidence of prior right-sided ventricular drain also seen. there appears to be interval decrease in size of subgaleal fluid and also apparent decrease in size of the previously demonstrated epidural low attenuation collections in the posterior fossa demonstrated on the ct scan of ___, although direct comparison is difficult due to difference in modality.
there is a large lobar hematoma in the left parietal lobe, as seen on the preceding ct scan. there is layering of heterogeneous blood products within the hematoma with a suggestion of a posterolateral clot, also concordant with the ct findings. there is mild edema surrounding the hematoma, with only minimal tenting of the posterior falx to the right. there is only minimal mass effect on the atrium of the left lateral ventricle. in the absence of intravenous contrast, it is difficult to exclude an underlying mass or associated abnormal draining veins. there is no evidence of increased susceptibility foci in other areas of the brain to suggest amyloid angiopathy or multiple cavernous malformations. there are numerous foci of high t2 signal in the subcortical, deep and periventricular white matter of the cerebral hemispheres, similar to ___ ___, likely representing advanced chronic small vessel ischemic disease. there is no evidence of an acute infarction. there is no pathologic extra- axial collection. a lesion is again seen extending from the right maxillary antrum into the right nasal cavity and right nasopharynx, suggestive of an antrochoanal polyp.
post-contrast images demonstrate no evidence of intraaxial or extraaaxial enhancing mass, cranial nerve enhancement or other leptomeningeal enhancement. there is no focal diffusion abnormality to suggest acute infarction. there is no mass effect, edema or evidence of blood products. ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration. principal vascular flow voids are preserved.
the patient is status post left craniotomy with resection of left-sided cavernous sinus and prepontine cistern mass. previously noted left subdural hemorrhage has decreased with residual subdural hematoma noted. expected postoperative changes are noted along the left temporal lobe. there is deformity of the left side of the pons with filling in of the surgical cavity and more nodular enhancement in this region compared to the prior examination. this area of nodular enhancement extends from the left pons through the prepontine cistern into the left cavernous sinus; residual neoplasm cannot be excluded. there is no shift of normally midline structures. there is mild dural thickening. there is no midline shift or hydrocephalus noted.
since the prior mri, as suspected on ct, there has been a small increase in the extent of high t2 signal abnormality in the white matter of the left frontal and parietal lobes, and also in the contralateral right parasagittal occipital cortex as well as subcortical white matter. left thalmic high t2 signal abnormality is stable. the patient is status post left parietal craniotomy and ___ resection. there is an ehnacing focus along the superior aspect of the resection cavity which previously demonstated solid nodular enhancement, but now demonstrates a thin rim of enhancement with central non-enhancement. while this focus appears slightly larger, the amount of enhancement actually appears smaller. otherwise, the irregular enhancement around the resection cavity appears stable in configuration. apparent decreased intensity of the enhancement may be due to differences in timing of the postcontrast sequences. there does not appear to be any additional mass effect on the ventricular system. on the gradient echo images, there are no definite new areas of hemorrhage. there are some areas of slow diffusion within the enhancing regions suggestive of cellularity, but no evidence of acute infarct. the major intracranial flow voids are maintained. the paranasal sinuses are clear.
there is a mild-to-moderate prominence of ventricles and sulci indicating mild brain atrophy. there is no midline shift or hydrocephalus. there is no evidence of age-inappropriate medial temporal atrophy seen. a few small foci of t2 hyperintensity are seen in the white matter indicating minimal changes of small vessel disease. following gadolinium, no evidence of abnormal parenchymal, vascular or meningeal enhancement is seen. there is no evidence of acute or chronic blood products identified on susceptibility- weighted images.
incomplete examination comprising of a single sagittal t1-weighted sequence and localizers, insufficient to provide any diagnostic information. please note, the patient has known metastatic disease with leptomeningeal and pachymeningeal involvement as well as calvarial and upper cervical spine osseous metastatic lesions described on the previous study from ___. these findings are not assessed on the current examination.
a lesion centered within the left thalamus demonstrates thick- walled nodular enhancement with patchy enhancement centrally with predominant non- enhancement centrally. the lesion measures 3.6 (cc) x 3.3 (ap) x 3 cm (tr). there is approximately 8 mm of rightward shift of midline of the massa intermedia at this level. superior and rightward mass effect is demonstrated upon the ipsilateral lateral ventricle. a relatively large region of high signal flair abnormality is detected associated with this lesion extending throughout the entire ipsilateral basal ganglia and into the surrounding corona radiata. there is inferior extension of a predominantly nonenhancing portion of the lesion inferiorly into the mid brain and pons. flair high signal abnormality is seen extending into the ipsilateral middle cerebellar peduncle. diffusion-weighted imaging demonstrates slow diffusion within the enhancing portion of the lesion which may suggest a component of high cellularity. within the nonenhancing portion, there is a predominant component of fast diffusion which is suggestive of necrosis.
status post left frontal craniotomy. post-surgical changes in the bone and adjacent soft tissues. there is a lobulated enhancing extra-axial mass lesion noted in the region of the posterior planum sphenoidale/superiorto the tuberculum sella, felt to represent a dural based lesion such as meningioma. it measures approximately 1.4 x 0.7 cm (series 401b, image 98) and is not significantly changed from the most recent study. this is increased in size since the earlier studies of ___. the lesion is in close proximity to the optic chiasm and a1 and a2 segments of the anterior cerebral artery. pituitary and infundibulum are normal. cystic foci in the adenoids as before.
again seen are post-operative changes in the sphenoid sinus, pituitary fossa, ___ and prepontine cistern related to transsphenoidal resection of pituitary lesion. hyperintense signal on t1- weighted imaging in the operative bed is compatible with fat within the packing material. adjacent to this region, in the area of the hypothalamus is again seen a focus of enhancement, not significantly changed from prior exam; however, inferior to this region in the ___, there is new new enhancing soft tissue, which may conceivably represent granulation tissue although not entirely clear. additionally, note is made of increased heterogeneous material within the sphenoid sinus. mild bilateral maxillary sinus disease is minimally improved. the prepontine cistern, dorsal to the clivus, contains non-enhancing material, which is not of csf signal intensity on flair images. this collection measures roughly 6 cm in a craniocaudad dimension, not significantly changed from prior exam. on post contrast images, there is thick pachymeningeal and faint linear leptomeningeal enhancement anterior and posterior to this collection, respectively. both vi cranial nerves traverses this collection and demonstrate uniform enhancement (9:11), present, in retrospect, on the previous study.
there are areas of increased t1 signal intensity in the right frontal lobe at the location of the previously resected lesion. this has heterogeneous signal intensity on the t2-weighted sequence, with areas of negative susceptibility within, related to blood products. there is moderate surrounding edema with mild leftward displacement of the midline structures and mass effect on the right lateral ventricle as before. evaluation for slow diffusion is confounded by the presence of blood products. no new areas of abnormal enhancement are noted, allowing for the enhancement of the dura on the right side, which is post-surgical. the ventricles are as described above. the major intracranial arterial flow voids are noted with a dominant left vertebral artery post-surgical changes are noted in the right frontal bone and the overlying soft tissues and the adjacent dura, with small fluid collections and blood products.
this study was compared with ___ ct scan. diffusion abnormality in the left middle cerebral artery territory, including the left temporal lobe, frontal lobe, insula, basal ganglia, and anterior left parietal lobe, correspond with areas of abnormality on the adc map, and also with the findings on the ct scan, representing an acute infarction. the magnetic susceptibility sequence demonstrates low signal within the left basal ganglia, suggesting the possibility of early hemorrhagic change, close follow up with non contrast head ct is recommended if clinically is warranted. additionally, mr angiography images demonstrate severe narrowing of the distal m1 segment of the left middle cerebral artery, partial filling of the m2 segments, and relative little filling of the ___ and m4 segments. the right- sided circulation, the anterior circulation, and posterior circulation appear patent. no other areas of infarction are seen. edema in the basal ganglia causes mass effect on the left lateral ventricle, however, there is negligible midline shift. perimesencephalic cisterns remain patent. incidentally noted are a polyp/retention cyst in the right maxillary sinus, and partial opacification of the right sphenoid sinus.
there is a new 6.0 x 5.2 x 5.0 cm mass centered within the right frontal lobe. the majority of the mass is cystic appearing with extensive peripheral enhancement with a nodular pattern of heterogeneous enhancement along the inferior margin of the tumor with a thick 13 mm rind. there is moderate surrounding vasogenic edema extending to the subcortical white matter. there is mass effect upon the lateral ventricles with approximately 6 mm of leftward shift of midline structures. there is no hydrocephalus. the tumor may extend down to the ependymal surface without diffuse ependymal enhancement. there is associated susceptibility artifact which likely represents intratumoral hemorrhage or perhaps calcification. no additional lesions were identified. there is facilitated diffusion centrally within the mass involving the cystic component with a thin peripheral rim of decreased diffusion.
the rim-enhancing right frontal corticomedullary 1.5-cm lesion with moderate surrounding edema is redemonstrated for surgical planning and demonstrates no significant short-interval change. a similar 1.2-cm lesion in the right gyrus rectus is also unchanged. no new lesions are identified. there is no significant change in ventricular or sulcal size.
there is an enhancing mass in the left parietal dural mass, which extends to the calvarium. there is minimal, if any, mass effect on the posterior frontal and anterior parietal parenchyma. no intraparenchymal metastatic lesions are identified. gliosis with evidence of laminar necrosis is again seen in the medial right occipital lobe, likely sequela of a chronic infarction. confluent low signal is seen in the deep and periventricular white matter of the cerebral hemispheres, unchanged since the previous study, which may represent sequela of whole brain radiation therapy, small vessel ischemic disease, or a combination of both. there is fluid in the sphenoid sinuses. the right maxillary sinus is nearly completely opacified. the right mastoid air cells are opacified.
multiple calvarial metastatic lesions are redemonstrated. however, no evidence of dural or brain metastasis is seen. there is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect, or acute infarction. a small amount of mucosal thickening is noted in the right sphenoid sinus; otherwise the visualized paranasal sinuses and the mastoid air cells appear clear. normal vascular flow voids are identified. the orbits appear unremarkable. diffuse heterogeneous appearance of the upper cervical spine and the clivus is likely due to metastatic disease also.
post-operative status is noted in the form of right suboccipital craniectomy defect. post operative changes are noted in the inferior aspect of the right cerebellar hemisphere, which appear hyperintense on flair images likely representing combination of gliosis and edema. there is extra-axial fluid collection noted along the right cerebellar hemisphere which is similar to the prior study. there is resolution of the edema and mass effect in the right cerebellar hemisphere as compared to the prior study. the lesion in the left occipital parasagittal region has increased in size and now measures 2.3 x 1.7 x 1.8 cm in craniocaudad, ap and transverse dimensions. the pattern of enhancement has changed, previously it showed homogenous enhancement and it now shows peripheral enhancement with central area of non-enhancement which likely represents necrosis. the lesion shows peripheral hypointensity on gradient echo images and mild peripheral slow diffusion which is likely due to residual blood products. the surrounding flair and t2-hyperintensity is unchanged. these findings appear more likely to represent treatment effect than progression of the neoplasm. mr perfusion imaging may be helpful to distinguish these possibilities. a small area of signal loss is noted on gradient echo image to the right side of midbrain. this is in the same location as compared to the prior mri and air was noted in this location in the prior ct. at that time it appeared to reflect post operative air. air should not persist over the two months since surgery. ct may be helpful to determine the source of this finding if clinically indicated. the ventricular size is stable as compared to the previous mri. right parietal craniotomy defect is noted. mucosal thickening is noted in bilateral ethmoid air cells. rest of the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells appear normal. post-cataract extraction status is noted of the left orbit.

again seen there is an extra-axial lesion along the left parietal region, measuring 3.5 x 3 x 3.6 cm in craniocaudal, ap and transverse dimensions. there is t1 hypointensity in the surrounding left parietal lobe white matter, which likely represents perilesional edema. the lesion causes mild mass effect on the left parietal lobe. ventricles and cortical sulci are age appropriate.
again are seen multiple scattered small areas of increased diffusion-weighted signal, particularly in the bilateral cerebral hemispheres in the white matter, internal capsules, and splenium. these areas also demonstrate a drop in signal on adc and hyperintensity on the flair images. the overall degree of signal intensity has decreased since prior exam. there is no edema or hemorrhage. there are no new areas of diffusion abnormality. a couple of the foci in the left frontal lobe have nearly completely resolved. the ventricles and sulci are prominent in size. a mucus-retention cyst sits within the right maxillary sinus and opacification of bilateral mastoid air cells suggests mastoiditis. the calvarium is thickened. the intracranial vertebral and internal carotid arteries and their major branches appear normal without evidence of stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm.
there are multifocal areas of slow diffusion in the left cerebellum and a single focus in the left posterior occipital cortex, with corresponding t2 signal abnormality on t2-weighted and flair sequences. these features are compatible with acute left pica and small pca embolic infarct. post-gadolinium images demonstrate complete occlusion involving a long segment of the left vertebral artery. there is faint enhancement in the small posterior parietal infarct, suggesting potential subacute nature. there is no mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures. the ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration.
the areas of t1 hyperintensity in the extra-axial space of the posterior fossa, surrounding the inferior aspect of the cerebellum bilaterally are stable in appearance. a focus of intrinsic t1 hyperintensity within the left cerebellar hemisphere as well is stable since the prior examination. no new focus of extra-axial collection is identified. no new focus of abnormal enhancement is seen. there is no mass effect or midline shift. the ventricles, sulci and cisterns are age-appropriate. as on the prior examination, there are punctate foci of susceptibility artifact on the gradient echo sequence diffusely scattered. this is stable overall in appearance since the most recent prior from one week ago. it does appear again significantly decreased in extent since all the other prior studies, although this may be related to differences in technique given that all the other prior imaging was performed at 3 tesla compared with the current and most recent prior which were performed at 1.5 tesla. the parenchyma otherwise demonstrates normal signal intensity. small developmental venous anomaly in the right frontal lobe (periventricular) is unchanged. the paranasal sinuses are essentially clear. there is small amount of fluid again noted in the mastoid air cells.
in the posterior left parietal lobe adjacent to the midline, mostly at the cortical surface, there are several fine serpentine vessels which likely represent an arteriovenous malformation, which is in the region of the contrast enhancement seen on earlier ct scan. small focus of susceptibility is noted in this area, which may represent calcification of a vessel or small focus of old hemorrhage. additionally, there are two areas of faintly increased signal on the axial flair images in the posterior fronto-superior cortex bilaterally, which are not reproduced in other sequences. there are no associated diffusion abnormalities, and these findings are of uncertain significance. no intracranial mass lesions are seen. there is no hydronephrosis or shift of normally midline structures. no major vascular territorial infarcts are apparent. the signal intensity values of the remaining portions of the brain parenchyma are normal. surrounding soft tissue and osseous strutures are unremarkable.
there is no evidence of midline shift, mass effect, hydrocephalus. no focal signal abnormalities are seen. diffusion weighted images demonstrate no evidence of area of restricted diffusion to indicate acute infarct. the vascular flow voids are maintained. extensive soft tissue changes are seen within the sphenoid sinus and soft tissue changes are also noted in the left maxillary sinus possibly related to intubation.
as described on the ct examination, there is an area of signal abnormality in the right frontal polar region with blood products in the area on pre gadolinium images. there is rim enhancement following gadolinium. there is edema in the right frontal lobe with mild mass effect on the anterior ___ of the right lateral ventricle. the enhancing component of the mass measures approximately 2 cm in all three dimensions. there are no other areas of abnormal areas of enhancement identified in the supra or infratentorial brain. an incidental venous angioma is identified in the left inferior frontal region. a subtle nodular area of enhancement seen on the coronal image in the left frontal region on image #137 of the coronal post gadolinium images appears to be due to a vascular structure. the ventricles and extra- axial spaces are normal in size. no evidence of midline shift, mass effect or hydrocephalus is identified.
in the left cerebellar peduncle, a small punctate increase signal is noted on diffusion-weighted imaging which is hypointense on the adc map indicating a small new infarct. the previously noted enhancing lesion within the posterior medulla is noted to have enlarged in size with a greater area of enhancement compared to previous studies. the study is otherwise unchanged from previous note of an old left thalamic infarct and an old left posterior cerebellar infarct in the region of the distal posterior-inferior cerebellar artery. there is no shift in normally midline structures or hydrocephalus noted. osseous structures and soft tissues are unremarkable.
the previously seen left supraclinoid aneurysm has been embolized in the interval. the coil pack is seen in the region of left supraclinoid internal carotid artery. there is no residual filling seen of the aneurysm on the pre- or post-contrast images of the mra. there is no vascular occlusion or stenosis seen. images through the brain demonstrate mild-to-moderate changes of small vessel disease. no evidence of midline shift, mass effect or hydrocephalus. no abnormal enhancement is seen.
the study is limited by patient motion. although no adc map was obtained, the signal intensity of restricted diffusion in bilateral occipital lobes is most consistent with infarction. there are additional areas of restricted diffusion. there is no intracranial mass lesion, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures. the signal intensity values of the remaining brain parenchyma are within normal limits. the ___-white matter differentiation is otherwise preserved. axial t1-weighted fat-saturated images demonstrate no area of high signal within the region of the right vertebral artery to suggest dissection. no definite right vertebral artery flow void is identified.
the flair sequence demonstrates a high signal intensity along the pachymeningeal area on the right parietal and right temporal regions, the possibility of a small subdural collection is also a consideration. additionally, the diffusion-weighted sequences demonstrate areas of restricted diffusion involving the bone marrow or diploe. no focal lesions of abnormal enhancement are detected within the brain parenchyma. normal flow void signal is noted in the major vascular structures. there is no evidence of hydrocephalus. there is no evidence of shifting of the normally midline structures. the orbits are unremarkable, the paranasal sinuses demonstrate normal pneumatization as well as in mastoid air cells.

as previously described there is enhancement extending throughout the left temporal lobe at the site of known glioblastoma. there is enhancement along the ependymal surface of the atrium of the left lateral ventricle. this has progressed slightly, as there is more enhancement now seen along the medial surface of the ventricular atrium. there is also slightly greater extent of increased t2 signal in the left occipital lobe and within the left posterior frontal and parietal white matter. there is a slightly greater mass effect associated with the medial left temporal lobe abnormality and it is indenting the left ambient cistern more than on the previous study, but no other structures are displaced and the ventricles are unchanged in size and configuration, compared to the previous study. in addition to enhancement at the tumor site, there is a faint nodule of enhancement in a left posterior frontal gyrus, at the ___/white margin (series 9, image 158) and also a small focus of enhancement in the subcortical white matter of the left anterior insula. right hemispheric structures have a normal appearance. there is a tiny focus of increased t2 signal in the high right frontal lobe subcortical white matter, but there is no associated enhancement.
again, an infarct is identified in the right frontal and parietal region. no evidence of new signal abnormalities or infarcts are identified compared to the previous study. on perfusion images, decreased signal indicating perfusion is identified in both cerebral hemispheres. evaluation of time-to-peak and mean transit times would be requirement for assessment of decreased or increased blood flow.

there is new abnormal signal within the left parietal lesion on susceptibility sequence, probably representing some intercurrent hemorrhage. the area of contrast enhancement appears to be somewhat broader than on the previous examination and the overall dimension of the lesion is increased now measuring 11 x 12 mm in cross sectional dimension on the coronal study. no additional abnormal signal foci or areas of contrast enhancement are noted, suggesting new intracranial metastatic disease. the complex lesion in the subcutaneous region on the right is again identified measuring 22 x 16 mm in size and consistent with a subcutaneous metastatic deposit.
the study is very limited secondary to early termination and lack of contrast images. within these limitations, no intracranial mass lesion, shift of normally midline structures, or evidence of acute minor or major vascular territorial infarct is apparent. global atrophy with prominence of the sulci and ventricles is noted, likely advanced for age. evidence of old right temporal lobe infarct is again noted. focus of t2 hyperintensity within the left pons may be artifactual, however, evaluation is limited and no flair images are available for review. fluid within the sphenoid sinuses and several ethmoid air cells is noted.
there is no evidence for intracranial metastatic disease. there is no hemorrhage, edema, mass or infarction seen. there is no diffusion or enhancement abnormality noted. flair-hyperintensities seen within the deep white matter and right external capsule are non-enhancing and, though non-specific, consistent with sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. incidental note is made of cavum septum pellucidum et vergae. there is no suspicious osseous lesion present. a small mucus-retention cyst is seen in the left maxillary sinus; otherwise, the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well- aerated.

there is a large surgical cavity in the right temporal lobe region which is unchanged in configuration. there are areas of enhancement along its medial margin which likely correspond to choroid plexus rather than residual tumor. however, there is a slight bulbous area of residual temporal lobe medial to the posterior portion of the resected tumor at the level of the peri-mesencephalic cistern which demonstrates some increased signal on flair imaging. although this is not changed in size or appearance since the prior study and demonstrates no enhancement, this region warrants close attention on followup studies. apart from new mucosal thickening in the left maxillary sinus, there are no additional changes since the prior study. there are no other regions of enhancement or other areas of concern for tumor recurrence. the craniotomy defect is noted on the right.
there are new enhancing masses of decreased t2 signal present along the ependymal margins of the posterior horns of both the right and left lateral ventricles and extending into the posterior corpus callosum, which are surrounded by areas of increased t2 signal, and consistent with lymphomatous/leukemic masses with edema. the edema in the right side of the brain extends from the posterior right parietal region to the right temporal subcortical white matter. this is increased compared to the prior study. there is no hydrocelphalus. also noted is abnormal marrow signal of the vertebral bodies that may be related to the patient's known history of cll. cervical lymphadenopathy is also demonstrated.

there is a focus of t2 hyperintensity in the left anterior frontal white matter most likely related to small vessel disease. the brain parenchyma is otherwise normal and there is no evidence of an infarct on the diffusion weighted images. as seen on the ct from 2 days previously, there is a mass in the medial aspect of the right middle cranial fossa. the mass involves the right cavernous sinus and encase the internal carotid artery although it maintains a normal flow void. given the clinical history, perineural spread of the squamous cell carcinoma with metastatic disease is the most likely diagnosis. no enlargement of the right foramen ovale or rotundum is seen on the bone images from the ct. the lesion extends medially, impinging upon the sella slighty and extends posteriorly and inferiorly, in the clivus. the bone marrow signal intensity elsewhere is normal.
there is no acute infarct seen on diffusion images. there are areas of low signal against the sulci in the right temporal region consistent with chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage in this location as seen on the previous ct. there is a focus of hyperintensity in the right parietal subcortical region indicative of a chronic-appearing infarct. there are mild-to-moderate changes of small vessel disease in the white matter. mild brain atrophy is seen. there is no midline shift or hydrocephalus. following gadolinium, no evidence of abnormal parenchymal, vascular or meningeal enhancement identified. the suprasellar and craniocervical regions are normal on the sagittal images. the vascular flow voids of the arterial structures and the sinuses are maintained.
on the t1 images there is a large area of hypodensity within the left temporal and occipital lobes with associated brain atrophy and sulcal efacement. this corresponds to an areas of hyperintensity seen on t2 images. on the diffusion weighted images there is no evidence of slow diffusion within this area. this likely represents an area of old infarction in the left pca territory. there appears to be an area of old hemorrhage within the infarction. there is evidence of periventricular white matter changes seen as t2 hyperintensity, predominantly in the left hemisphere, consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic changes. in addition there are lacunar infarcts present in both cerebellar hemispheres. there is no evidence of acute intraparenchymal or extraaxial hemorrhage. there is no acute territorial infarction, intracranial mass, or shift of normally midline structures noted. review of the diffusion weighted images show no areas of restricted diffusion. mra of the brain shows decreased flow signal within the left pca. there is also decreased flow signal within the left vertebral artery. the right vertebral and basilar arteries appear normal. the remaining vessels of the circle of ___ and intracranial / extracranial carotid arteries appear normal. the lens of the left eye is dislocated and positioned within the center of the globe.

there are no definite foci of decreased diffusion noted in the brain parenchyma. nonspecific flair hyperintense foci are noted in the cerebral white matter related to small vessel ischemic changes in the periventricular location in the frontal lobes. the ventricles are unremarkable. prominent cerebral sulci in the fissures are noted, related to volume loss. on the post-contrast images, there is no focus of abnormal enhancement. mucosal thickening is noted in the left maxillary sinus along with fluid.

there has been no significant change seen. left parietal craniotomy and postoperative changes and encephalomalacia are noted. there are no new enhancing lesions seen. no abnormal enhancement is seen in the area of his previous surgical resection. there is no mass effect, midline shift or hydrocephalus. mild changes of small vessel disease are seen.
the susceptibility images demonstrate multiple areas of susceptibility along the sulci of both cerebral hemispheres as well as in the posterior portion of both lateral ventricles indicative of subarachnoid and intraventricular blood. this correlates with the clinical history of subarachnoid hemorrhage. the diffusion weighted images demonstrate no definite area of restricted diffusion to indicate acute infarct. no evidence of midline shift is seen. severe periventricular white matter changes indicate small vessel disease. no evidence of midline shift or hydrocephalus is noted. there is prominence of ventricles and sulci indicative of cerebral atrophy. the mra of the head is limited by motion. flow is seen in both intracranial carotids but the evaluation of middle cerebral and anterior cerebral arteries is limited. flow signal is also visualized in the basilar artery but evaluation of distal flow in this region is limited by motion.
unchanged large intraparenchymal hemorrhage is demonstrated on the left basal ganglia with associated vasogenic edema, causing mass effect and midline shifting towards the left, approximately 1.9 mm of shifting is demonstrated on the axial t2-weighted sequences (image 13, series #6). few scattered foci of restricted diffusion are demonstrated on the right occipital lobe, right posterior basal ganglia, both centrum semiovale, likely consistent with a thromboembolic ischemic event. few scattered foci of high signal intensity are noted in the subcortical white matter on t2 and flair, likely reflecting chronic microvascular ischemic changes. a focal area of vasogenic edema is noted in both occipital lobes, more conspicuous on the left. the orbits are grossly unremarkable. the paranasal sinuses demonstrate mucosal thickening at the ethmoidal air cells, sphenoid sinus, and left maxillary sinus, there is also patchy mucosal thickening at the mastoid air cells.
a drainage catheter from a right frontal approach terminates within the anterior third ventricle. slight dilatation of the supratentorial ventricular system that is most prominent within the temporal horns of both lateral ventricles is associated with abnormal signal within the periventricular white matter that represent the sequelae of the patient's previous hydrocephalus. there is no evidence of shift of normally midline structures. foci of abnormal signal on susceptibility imaging are present within the right caudate nucleus, the putamen, the right insular cortex, and within the third ventricle. these foci of abnormal signal on susceptibility imaging correspond with areas of calcification seen on the patient's recent ct. areas of ring enhancement are seen within the right putamen and right caudate nucleus. the focus of ring enhancement within the right caudate nucleus extends to the ependymal surface of the anterior ___ of the right lateral ventricle. a ___ mm cystic lesion without significant enhancement is positioned at the junction of the posterior third ventricle and the cerebral aqueduct. this cystic lesion is seen on coronal, sagittal, and axial images. the fourth ventricle and cerebral aqueduct are normal in appearance. .

there are numerous tiny foci of negative susceptibility scattered throughout the brain, in the cerebral hemispheres on both sides, basal ganglia, thalami, and the cerebellar hemispheres as well as the brainstem. given the distribution and the age of the patient, these may relate to hypertensive microhemorrhages, amyloid angiopathy, or several small cavernomas. a large area of hemorrhage is noted in the right thalamus, extending into the right side of the midbrain and pons with heterogeneous signal intensity related to the blood products and some surrounding edema. a small focus of increased signal intensity is also noted in the left cerebellar hemisphere which may relate to edema in addition to adjacent encephalomalacic changes. some of the lesions in cerebelalr hemispheres demonstrate typical hypointense rim on the t2-weighted sequences and may relate to cavernomas. on the post-contrast images, there is no obvious abnormal enhancement noted in the area of hemorrhage in the right thalamus/extending into the brainstem. no obvious abnormal enhancement is noted in the several areas of negative susceptibility noted. there are multiple small scattered flair hyperintense foci in the cerebral white matter without associated decreased diffusion, which are nonspecific in appearance. tiny hyperintense focus noted on the sagittal mp-rage sequence in the cerebellar hemispheres may represent blood products and assessment of enhancement is limited on the mp-rage sequence due to lack of pre-contrast images. the major intracranial arterial flow voids are noted. mild mucosal thickening is noted in the maxillary sinuses, moderate in the ethmoid air cells and the sphenoid sinuses. small amount of fluid/mucosal thickening is noted in the mastoid air cells.

the patient is status post left parietal craniotomy and resection of a previously seen enhancing mass in the left parietal lobe. there is intrinsic t1 hyperintensity and susceptibility within the resection cavity, likely representing hemorrhagic products. there is a small focus of possible enhancement just at the inferior margin of the resection cavity, although this is quite subtle and best seen on image 15 of series 10 compared to the pre-contrast series 4. there is pachymeningeal enhancement overlying the resection cavity, likely postoperative in nature. there is also corresponding flair hyperintensity, which may represent a small extra-axial collection in this location. no other enhancing focus is identified. the ventricles, sulci, and cisterns are stable in configuration, with slight rightward midline shift, not significantly changed since the prior study. there is local mass effect and sulcal effacement, which appears somewhat improved compared to the preoperative study. there is decreased diffusion along the resection cavity margin, which may be related to the hemorrhagic products versus devitalized tissue along the resection margin. no other area of decreased diffusion is identified. the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. the orbits and soft tissues are otherwise unremarkable.
very limited study due to motion artifact. there is soft tissue swelling in the right frontal and periorbital subcutaneous soft tissues representing an evolving hematoma. there are no foci of slow diffusion to suggest acute ischemia. there is a focus of susceptibility artifact in the sub-cortical right frontal lobe likely representing hemosiderin deposition. there is no gross abnormal enhancement. there are few scattered periventricular t2 flair hyperintensities. there is cortical atrophy more than expected for patient's age. the major intracranial flow voids including those of the major dural venous sinuses are preserved. no shift of the midline structures or central herniation is identified mucosal thickening of the ehtmoid air cells and sphenoid sinuses.

the patient is status post suboccipital craniotomy with post-surgical changes in the posterior fossa, extra-axial soft tissues as well as in the peripheral posterior part of the right cerebellar hemisphere with mild decrease in the anterior component seen on the prior study. on the post-contrast images, there is marked enhancement in the extra-axial soft tissues at the surgical site, that has increased compared to the prior study with resolution of the nonenhancing component and this may relate to evolution of the fluid collection with inflammation and granulation tissue/scar formation. a non-enhancing fluid component located anterior to this, measuring 2.4x1.3cm, is grossly unchanged. assessment of the adjacent dural venous sinus is limited on the present study due to the post-surgical changes. assessment of decreased diffusion is limited on this location due to the presence of negative susceptibility artifacts related to old blood products/post surgical changes. hence, significance of a small focus of increased dwi signal is uncertain. clinical correlation is recommended to exclude infection in this location.

within the left posterior parietal and temporal lobes there is an area of t1 hyperintensity, corresponding to the area of hemorrhage on the previous ct. this does not exhibit enhancement on the post-contrast images to clearly identify a mass lesion- there is a possible small area of superficial vascular enhancement seen along the lateral aspect of the area of hemorrhage. this would be unlikely to be the source of the hemorrhage, given its location. there is new overlying scalp soft tissue swelling near the craniotomy at this site. there is a small amount of gas within the area of t1 high signal consistent with pneumocephalus from the recent craniotomy. this area has areas of both increased and decreased t2 signal as well as surrounding increased t2 signal, the latter consistent with edema. also there are areas of susceptibility consistent with the patient's known hemorrhage in this site. in the periventricular white matter there are areas of t2 signal hyperintensity on both the t2 and flair imaging consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic changes. there are no new areas of intracranial hemorrhage. there is no shift of normally mid-line structures. there is mild mass effect exhibited on the left occipital ___ of the ventricle due to the adjacent hemorrhage. this is improved slightly compared to the prior study.
