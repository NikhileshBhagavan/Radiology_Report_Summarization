this study confirms the extradural lobulated mass at c5-6 on the left side. long axis of the mass measures about 2.3 cm and demonstrates heterogeneous enhancement. again noted is hemorrhage along the spinal canal anteriorly which extends up to the posterior fossa. enhancement of the dura is also noted, which probably reflects the reaction of the meninges to hemorrhage or presumed neoplasm. other findings remain unchanged.
there is no appreciable change from previous study. there is congenital spinal stenosis seen throughout the lumbar spine, secondary to the presence of short pedicles. superimposed upon congenital stenosis are other degenerative changes as discussed below. the l3/4 level demonstrates mild broad-based disc bulging and mild facet hypertrophy. these changes result in minimal central canal stenosis at this level. this is unchanged from previous study. the l4/5 level demonstrates moderate central canal stenosis secondary to disc bulging and mild facet disease with ligamentous hypertrophy. bilateral moderate neural foraminal narrowing is seen as well. the l5/s1 level demonstrates no significant central canal stenosis or neural foraminal compromise. there is suggestion of a disc herniation at the t10/11 disc space. this finding is imaged at the edge of the field of view and not fully assessed by this study. please refer to the previous examination of ___ for more information regarding this region. the conus medullaris and distal spinal cord appear unremarkable in caliber and signal. the abdominal aorta appears somewhat enlarged, measuring 3.3 cm in greatest diameter.

cervical vertebral alignment is maintained. there are end-plate osteophytes and disc bulges at several cervical levels, especially c4-5, c5-6 and c6-7 levels. the degree to which these impinge on the spine canal is unclear, since imaged resolution is suboptimal, but there is suspicion of canal stnosis at c6-7. the cervicomedullary junction appears normal and the foramen magnum is normally wide. in the upper thoracic spine, there is csf seen anterior and posterior to the cord. there is suspicion of canal narrowing at roughly the c7-t1 level.
the visualized brain and spinal cord are normal in signal intensity. there is a mild posterior disc protrusion at the c5-c6 level. this causes no significant central canal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing. the remaining disc, vertebral bodies and uncovertebral joints are normal. the prevertebral soft tissues are unremarkable.

again demonstrated is the left psoas abscess in the medial aspect of the psoas compartment. this abscess is in continuity with the left-sided lumbar punctures in the l4 nerve root. once again contrast enhancement within the spinal canal is noted. on today's examination i would prefer to consider this as being located in the epidural compartment rather than the intradural compartment. there is no convincing evidence of an epidural abscess component. there is no definite continuity demonstrated between the psoas abscess and the epidural space although these spaces are in anatomic continuity and continuity of infection may well be present. the psoas abscess measures 3.3 by 17 x 11 mm in size at the present time.

there is degenerative disease at multiple levels. at c4-c5 there is mild bilateral foramen stenosis. at c5-c6 there is a broad-based disc osteophyte bar centrally together with mild bilateral foramen stenosis. this is producing mild central canal stenosis at this level. at c6-c7 there is a mild disc osteophyte broad-based bar formation. there is no definite evidence of high grade canal or foraminal stenosis at this level.

from c6 to t3 level, there is a fluid collection identified with hyper- and isointense t1 and hypointense t2 signal to the right of midline posteriorly to the thecal sac and indenting the thecal sac and spinal cord with approximately 25-50% narrowing of the spinal canal at that level. findings are most consistent with an acute subdural hematoma. additionally, there is evidence of increased signal posteriorly within the soft tissues extending to the intraspinous region at c6-7 level with subtle discontinuity of the intraspinous ligaments indicative of ligamentous injury. there is disc bulging and osteophyte formation at this c6-7 level with indentation on the anterior aspect of the spinal cord. multilevel degenerative changes are also seen at other levels in the cervical region. no evidence of increased signal is seen within the spinal cord. subtle increased signal identified anterior to the spinal cord on inversion recovery images appears to be secondary to mild prevertebral edema.
postsurgical changes in the cervical midline posterior soft tissues are identified. there is fluid within the surgical cavity, not much changed since the previous study, though the drains have been removed. in the deep soft tissues and cervical musculature, just lateral to the surgical defect, there is extensive enhancement and there are areas of necrosis, consistent with infection of the soft tissues. abnormal enhancement extends anterolaterally, more on the left than the right to encompass the facet joint complexes and vertebral artery at the c5 and c6 levels. abnormal signal within the left facets at c4/5 and c5/6 was evident on the previous study as well. this may be postoperative in nature or related to infectious involvement of these structures. the cervical spinal cord is decompressed. decompression extends into the upper thoracic region, as far inferiorly as t5. no paraspinal abnormalities are identified in the upper thoracic region. the previously identified retropharyngeal swelling is decreased. there continues to be abnormal enhancement in the left longus coli muscle. there is abnormally increased t2 signal and enhancement of the c5 vertebral body. this is suggestive of infection involving this bone. there is slight loss of vertebral body height as well. cervical spinal cord signal cannot be adequately assessed due to motion artifact.
since the previous mri study the patient has undergone extensive laminectomy extending from c4 to t6 level. the previously seen collection posterior to the spinal cord in the upper thoracic and lower cervical region has been removed. there is no new collection seen within the spinal canal in the thoracic region. extensive soft tissue changes are seen posteriorly secondary to surgical procedure. an area of increased signal is identified within the spinal cord at c4 level indicating cord edema or myelomalacia which is unchanged from the previous study. the prevertebral soft tissues are well maintained. there is no evidence of fluid collection seen in the prevertebral soft tissues in the cervical or thoracic region. mild multilevel degenerative changes are identified in the thoracic region. in the cervical region degenerative changes are also noted as before.

the vertebrae are diffusely abnormal with loss of signal intensity and hypointensity. the height is relatively preserved. disc desiccation is noted at the level of l4-5. evaluation of the postcontrast images demonstrates linear enhancement along the anterior and posterior aspects of the distal spinal cord raising the suspicion of meningeal involvement. at the level of l4-5, there is a moderate-sized central and left paracentral disc herniation indenting the ventral aspect of the thecal sac and compressing the left l5 nerve root as it exits the thecal sac. no significant central canal stenosis noted.
there appears to be overall normal alignment of the cervical spine. however, the combination of motion artefact and susceptibility artefact obscure images of portions of the mid and inferior cervical spine and upper thoracic spine. there are no findings on this examination to suggest ligamentous disruption. however, note that the sensitivity of mr examinations, even with technically adequate, for detecting ligamentous injury is unknown. the current examination is clearly inferior to the usual cervical spine mr for this purpose. no definite signal intensity abnormalities are noted in the spinal cord. however, due to supraimposed motion artefact, possibility of spinal cord signal intensity abnormalities cannot be excluded. the gradient echo images are nondiagnostic.
there is loss of the normal lordotic cervical curvature. no signal abnormality is seen within the vertebral bodies. evaluation of the spinal cord is limited by patient motion, but there is no gross signal abnormality within the spinal cord. vertebral bodies are normal in height. there is no prevertebral stir abnormality to indicate a ligamentous injury. there is increased signal on stir sequences within the posterior paraspinal musculature, likely indicative of a soft tissue injury in this region. note is made that the increased signal extends into the space between the c4 and c5 spinous processes. there is a rightward paracentral disc protrusion of the c4/5 intervertebral disc, which causes mild narrowing of the neural foramen at this level, but does not contact the ventral cord surface, or cause cord compression.
from t10-11 to l3-4 no abnormalities are seen. at l4-5 mild disc bulging and degenerative disc disease is noted with broad based central disc protrusion slightly indenting the thecal sac. at l5-s1 level disc degenerative changes are seen with a central and right paracentral disc herniation displacing the right s1 nerve root. the distal spinal cord shows normal signal intensities.
the study was abbreviated due to patient inability to lie back, despite conscious sedation with multiple medications. adequate precontrast t1 and t2w sagittal and axial images were obtained. the alignment of the vertebral bodies is normal in unchanged. increased signal is seen in a linear distribution under the superior endplate of t12 on t1 and t2w images; slight anteriorwedging of this vertebral body has developed, consistent with a wedge insufficiency compression deformity. a focus of t1 and t2 hyperintensity is seen within the inferior portion of the right l2 body, unchanged in appearance and consistent with small hemangioma. prominent extradural t1 hyperintense material, presumably fat, lines the posterior spinal canal; this deposit has widened slightly in the upper and mid portions of the lumbar spine and has increased moderately in width at the l4/5 levels. this is best appreciated on the axial t1w images. mild degenerative changes are again identified at l5/s1 level, stable in appearance. there is no evidence of disc herniation.
mild disc degenerative signal is noted in the cervical discs from c3-4 to c6-7 level. no evidence of extrinsic spinal cord compression, significant disc bulge, stenosis or foraminal narrowing is seen. from the skull base to the t2 level, there is no evidence of extrinsic spinal cord compression or intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities. from t3 to t5 level, there is increase in fat seen on the posterior epidural space. at t4 and t5 level, there is extrinsic indentation on the posterior aspect of the spinal cord by epidural fat. there is no intrinsic signal abnormalities seen. there have been no significant change since the previous study. following gadolinium, no abnormal enhancement is seen.

alignment of the cervical spine is normal. the spinal cord signal intensity appears normal. axial images at c3-4 demonstrate a broad-based bulge at the inner vertebral disc that narrows the spinal canal but does not compress the spinal cord. motion artifact limits evaluation of the neural foramina. however, there appears to be mild-moderate bilateral foraminal narrowing. at l4-5, intervertebral osteophytes and a broad-based bulge of the disc narrows the spinal canal and flattens the spinal cord. there appears to be moderate-severe neural foraminal narrowing bilaterally. again, neural foraminal evaluation is limited by motion artifact. at c5-6, intervertebral osteophyte formation and a left-sided protrusion of the disc narrow the spinal canal and deform the spinal cord. there appears to be severe bilaterall foraminal narrowing, again with the evaluation limited by motion artifact. at c6-7, there is canal narrowing due to osteophyte formation and a bulge of the intervertebral disc. there is a suggestion of a protrusion of the disc material into the left neural foramen, however, the images are heavily degraded by motion artfiact and are of limited value. axial images at c7-t1 demonstrate possible bilateral foraminal narrowing, somewhat worse on the left than the right. again, evaluation is limited by motion artifact. there is no encroachment on the spinal canal or spinal cord at this level.

overall appearance of the lumbosacral spine is stable since the previous study. there continues to be abnormal enhancement throughout the lumbosacral spinal canal. there is enhancement surrounding the nerve roots of the cauda equina, which are posteriorly and laterally displaced by a central ventral t1 hypointense collection which appears to be intra or subdural in location. there is enhancement surrounding this collection as well. alignment of the vertebrae is unchanged. pedicle screws obscure some detail. there is decreased enhancement in central collection in the laminectomy defect, compared to the previous examination. abnormally increased t2 signal was evident in the conus medullaris. within the ventral distal thoracic spinal canal, there is a csf signal collection which may represent loculated fluid. this is seen on a previous examination, and is unchanged. as noted on the previous examination, there is marked irregularity of the endplate margins at the l5-s1 interspace and there is abnormal enhancement in this location, raising the possibility of infection, though stability of the changes and absence of frank epidural or perivertebral enhancing abnormality, suggests that this may be degenerative.
at the craniocervical junction and at c2-3, no abnormalities are identified. at c3-4, mild disc bulging and degenerative changes are noted. at c4-5 to c6-7, moderate diffuse disc bulging and indentation on the thecal sac are seen. no evidence of high-grade spinal stenosis or extrinsic spinal cord compression is seen. at c7-t1 and inferiorly to t4-5, disc degenerative changes are identified without spinal stenosis. the spinal cord demonstrates normal intrinsic signal. soft tissue changes are seen within the sphenoid sinus and in the nasopharynx which could be secondary to intubation. the prevertebral soft tissue thickness is well maintained. the axial images are limited by motion and foraminal changes could not be evaluated.
this study is limited by motion artifact which occurred despite patient sedation. the motion limits the diagnostic quality of the images. however, there is edema seen at the l4-5 level. there is also increased signal intensity in the s2 vertebral body on t2w images, findings which are consistent with a fracture. the spinal cord appears abnormal and has a wavy contour. the possibility of an intraspinal or intradural process cannot be excluded. this study should be repeated when the patient can hold still to further evaluate the spine.
there are postoperative changes extending from c2 to c4 level with metallic implants within the vertebral bodies and posteriorly. there is soft tissue mass indicating metastatic disease involving the lateral masses from c2 to c4 level bilaterally, left greater than right side. on the left side, the mass surrounds the vertebral artery. there is no intraspinal extension or epidural enhancement. no evidence of spinal cord compression is seen. there is no extrinsic spinal cord signal abnormality. there have been laminectomies in the upper cervical region from c2 to c4 level. prevertebral soft tissues are maintained.
again there is considerable motion on the study. there appears to be possibly be subdural fluid accumulation at l2. the thecal sac contour below this level appears to be somewhat narrow and pressed together raising the question of some epidural fluid process, perhaps hematoma in this region. the abnormal signal from l4 to the sacrum is a little less prominent on today's examination. the subcutaneous abnormal signal remains present. there is no definite evidence of abnormal signal associated with the lumbar vertebral bodies. persistent abnormal signal at s2 is noted consistent with sacral fracture.
there is no specific evidence of discitis or osteomyelitis in the cervical spine. the cervical cord dimension and signal are not remarkable. there is no definite evidence of focal disc protrusion. evaluation of the neural foramina is somewhat limited due to patient motion.
lumbosacral vertebral alignment is normal. vertebral body height is maintained. no signal intensity abnormalities are identified within the vertebral bodies. there is mild degenerative change at the l5/t1 intervertbral disc, without canal or foraminal narrowing. in the lower lumbar region, where axial images were obtained, there is no evidence of a paraspinal abnormality. the conus is in normal position and has a normal appearance.
as described in the patient's recent ct scan, there is ___ ___ fracture of the l1 vertebral body. there is retropulsion of the fracture fragments with narrowing of the central canal. the degree of retropulsion is stable since the ct scan. there is no compression of the cauda equina. there is no evidence of disk herniation, though the l1-2 disk does appear disrupted. no intraspinal fluid collections are identified. the remainder of the alignment in the lumbar spine is normal. there is a disk protrusion with disk desiccation at l4-5. this disk protrusion results in no impingement on the central canal or neural foramina bilaterally. it's age is indeterminate.
at the craniocervical junction, a small amount of fluid is seen at the tip of the odontoid process which could be related to mild inflammatory changes or degenerative changes. there is no evidence of neural abnormality seen. at c2-3 and c3-4, disc degenerative changes are identified without foraminal narrowing. at c4-5 to c6-7, disc degenerative changes are identified. at c5-6 level, mild endplate signal abnormalities are seen which appear to be secondary to degenerative changes. no evidence of spinal stenosis or high-grade foraminal narrowing is seen. the spinal cord shows normal signal intensities.
there is straightening of cervical curvature noted. increased signal is noted in the c7 and c3 vertebral bodies, consistent with known fractures. there is prevertebral soft tissue swelling noted from the level of c1 to c4. there is increased signal noted in the posterior soft tissues along the posterior elements from the level of c2 to c6, consistent with ligamentous injury. no evidence of cord compression noted.
examination is somewhat limited by motion artifact. as previously noted, there is increased t2 signal in the l2-3 and l3-4 intervertebral discs. there is enhancement of thickened epidural tissues posterior to the l2-3 interspace and also extending slightly superior to this, posterior to l2, and perhaps into the epidural space behind the l1-2 disc. none of the enhancing epidural abnormality produces canal stenosis or neural compression. the superior endplate of l2 is somewhat irregular. there is no definite evidence of paraspinal abnormality, though images are limited due to motion artifact. the conus cannot be adequately evaluated due to motion.
there is no evidence of epidural abscess or osteomyelitis in the visualized images. soft tissue tract associated with the stated history of the sacral ulcer presumably lies slightly below the imaged area. similarly, the distal coccyx is not seen in this study although sagittal images of the sacrum appear unremarkable. on the sagittal stir image, there is a rim of increased signal suggesting the presence of fluid. at l4-l5, there is grade 1 spondylolisthesis. there is a question of possible spondylosis on the right, but more likely the spondylolisthesis is secondary to degenerative changes, which are seen to a milder extent at other levels. at l5-s1 there is a posterior herniation of the intervertebral disk, particularly on the left, with mild spinal stenosis and possible displacement of the s1 nerve root inparticular. the visualized distal spinal cord, conus, and cauda equina are unremarkable. there are a large round uterine mass which is most likely a fibroid and could be better assessed with ultrasound.
there is increased t2 signal intensity involving the dorsal aspect of the pons and the medulla as previously noted on the brain mri examination. findings are suspicious for brain stem post traumatic injury. no abnormal signal intensity is noted in the cervical cord. the cervical spine is in gross anatomic alignment with normal vertebral body height and marrow signal. there is no evidence of cervical cord compression.
again noted is the abnormal signal intensity involving the l5 vertebral body which involves both pedicles and transverse process as well as the remainder of the posterior elements. the overall epidural disease appears less extensive than the ___, examination. however still compresses and displaces the thecal sac posteriorly with extension into the bilateral neural foramina, right greater than left affecting both exiting l5 nerve roots. the extent of the epidural disease inferiorly into the s1 vertebral body on the right is increased. no abnormal signal intensity noted in the distal thoracic cord conus which terminates at l1-2.
sagittal images demonstrate grossly normal anteroposterior alignment of the cervical vertebrae. there are degenerative changes at the intervertebral disc spaces. this results in spinal canal stenosis at c3/4, c4/5, c5/6, and, to a lesser degree, at c6/7. the neural foramina are difficult to evaluate due to poor signal in the images. there are no frank disc herniations. there is the suggestion of slightly increased t2 signal within the spinal cord at the c4/5 level. prevertebral edema is evident. there is also increased t2 signal, likely representing edema, in the posterior deep soft tissues. the vertebral arteries cannot be adequately evaluated with this exam.
mild multilevel degenerative changes are seen in the cervical region with mild disc bulging from c3-4 to c6-7. no evidence of high grade spinal stenosis or foraminal narrowing is seen. the spinal cord from skull base to t4 level demonstrates no evidence of extrinsic compression. the evaluation for intrinsic abnormalities limited as described above secondary to pulsation artifacts and motion. there is subtle increased signal seen on the right side of the cord at the cervicomedullary junction and on the left side at c6 level. however, this might need further evaluation with repeat sagittal and axial t2 weighted images if clinically indicated. no enhancing lesions are identified.
as seen on the ct there is fracture through the body of c5 vertebra. there is a fluid collection seen in the prevertebral region measuring 5 mm indicating prevertebral hematoma. there is no evidence of vertebral mal-alignment. there is no evidence of disruption of the posterior longitudinal or interspinous ligaments. there is no evidence of epidural hematoma or fluid collection within the spinal canal. there is no evidence of extrisinc spinal cord compression or intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities. mild increased signal is seen in the posterior soft tissues of the neck which could be related to trauma. old compressions of t4 and t5 are noted. extensive soft tissue changes are seen in the visualized sphenoid sinus which could be secondary to intubation.
the vertebra are normal in height, alignment and signal intensity. disc desiccation noted in all the disc spaces. at the level of c5-6 and c6-7: moderate central disc protrusion is noted indenting the ventral aspect of the thecal sac and causing moderate central canal stenosis. evaluation of the neural canal is limited, as there is motion noted on the axial images. the remainder of the disc spaces are unremarkable.
cervical vertebral alignment is normal. vertebral body height and signal are maintained. there is no abnormal enhancement of the spinal structures. no disk herniations are present and there is no canal or foraminal narrowing. the foramen magnum is normally wide. the cerebellar tonsils are in normal position. there is a single linear area of soft tissue density in the right lung apex.
there continues to be extensive abnormality at the l5-s1 interspace with the appearance of a central fluid-filled space surrounded by enhancing soft tissue and complete obliteration of the disc space and part of s1. the extent of this necrotic-appearing or fluid-filled space is decreased since the previous study. the spinal canal remains narrowed, especially at the lumbosacral junction. the paraspinal musculature has abnormal enhancement, and there may be abscesses within the iliopsoas muscles, but this abnormality is of decreased magnitude, compared to the previous study. no new areas of abnormal signal are identified within the lumbosacral spine to suggest new sites of infection.
there is overall normal alignment of the cervical spine with no subluxation or evidence of significant degenerative disease. there is no evidence of involvement with metastatic disease. there is some ligamentous thickening posteriorly along the c2 body extending into the cervicomedullary subarachnoid space. however, there is no effacement of the cerebrospinal fluid space, and it is doubtful that the ligamentous thickening would be symptomatic. the partially visualized structures of the posterior fossa and spinal cord appear unremarkable.
at the craniocervical junction, no abnormalities are seen. at c2-3, disc degenerative change and mild bulging is seen without spinal stenosis. at c3-4, mild disc bulging and moderate right foraminal narrowing is seen. at c4-5 and c5-6, disc uncovertebral changes are seen with moderate right- sided foraminal narrowing at c4-5, and moderate bilateral foraminal narrowing at c5-6 levels. at c6-7, there is partial obliteration of the intervertebral disc. mild bilateral foraminal narrowing is seen. at c7-t1, and inferiorly to t2-3, disc degenerative changes are seen. the spinal cord demonstrates normal intrinsic signal.
sagittal images demonstrate normal lumbo-sacral vertebral alignment. there are no focal signal abnormalities within the vertebrae. there is desiccation of the l5-s1 and vertebral disk and there is a small posterior anular tear. this disk is bulging, but it does not directly impinge on nerve roots. there is mild facet degenerative enlargement at the l5-s1 levels. the remaining lumbar intervertebral disk spaces are normal. the conus is in normal position and has a normal appearance.
there is normal alignment. the vertebral bodies demonstrate normal signal intensities and height. note is made of some motion artifact limiting evaluation of the distal spinal cord with no definite abnormality and the conus medullaris terminating at the l1 level. the previously-identified mild degenerative changes, most pronounced at the l1/2 level are not significantly changed. there is no spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.
the enhancing lesions with a central area of heterogeneous enhancement involving the l4 vertebral body and also the right iliac bone are the sites of metastatic disease. for details, please refer to ___ mri report. no abnormal enhancement of the distal thoracic cord or the conus is seen. however, this does not exclude leptomeningeal metastatic disease, and csf analysis may be helpful.
there is no malalignment of the cervical spine, and there is no definite evidence of ligamentous injury. from c3 through c7, there are small posterior disc osteophyte complexes, which do not indent the thecal sac. at c5-c6, there is bilateral foraminal narrowing associated with the disc osteophyte complex. at other levels, there is no evidence of foraminal narrowing. at all levels, there is no evidence of spinal stenosis. the visualized spinal cord, foramen magnum, and its contents appear unremarkable. there are no abnormal intensities in the spinal cord. the surrounding soft tissues appear unremarkable.
the vertebrae are normal in height, alignment and signal intensity. disc desiccation is noted in all lumbar disc spaces. the distal spinal cord is unremarkable. at l1-2 and l2-3: no significant disc disease or central or neural canal stenosis is noted. at l3-4, mild diffuse disc bulge is noted with no significant central or neual canal stenosis. at l4-5 there is mild diffuse disc bulge noted with no significant central or neural canal stenosis. at l5-s1 there is mild diffuse disc bulge noted. there is facet and uncinate hypertrophy noted. there is epidural lipomatosis noted, which appears to cause mild to moderate central canal stenosis. endplate degenerative changes are noted in the adjacent endplates at l5-s1.
please refer to the total spine mri report dated ___. contrast enhancement associated with the c5 vertebral body metastatic lesion with compression fracture is seen. no abnormal enhancement of the cervical cord is seen. however, the possibility of leptomeningeal metastatic disease cannot be completely excluded and cerebrospinal fluid analysis is suggested.
there is normal alignment. the vertebral body heights are preserved. there is again demontrated abnormal increased t1 marrow signal in the vertebral bodies at and below the t1 level most consistent with radiation change. the vertebral body heights are preserved with otherwise preserved signal intensities. the visualized spinal cord, foramen magnum and the spinal contents are unremarkable with normal signal intensities. there is no encroachment into the canal or neural foraminal narrowing. the partially visualized portions of the upper thoracic spine and right lung apex again demonstrate a right suprahilar mass resulting in mild anterior scalloping of the t2 and t3 vertebral bodies. given the limitations of the differences in technique and scanning planes, this does not appear dramatically different but may have progressed slightly. within this region there is also no evidence of encroachment of the spinal canal.
there is a comminuted burst type fracture of the l2 vertebral body with retropulsion of a large fracture fragment resulting in greater than 50% narrowing of the spinal canal. the conus is seen to occur at the l1-2 level, just superior to the fracture. the retropulsed fragment displaces and compresses the spinal nerve roots, which are not individually identified. there is low signal seen within the expected location of the left lateral recess at the l2-3 level, though individual nerve roots cannot be discerned at this level. there is no definite evidence of epidural hemorrhage, though this is difficult to assess due to the large amount of retropulsed fragments. there is a slight kyphotic angulation surrounding the level of injury. above and below this level, the vertebral bodies have normal signal, height, and alignment. there is a mild amount of signal abnormality within the l5-s1 intervertebral disc which likely represents early degenerative change.
this study is being compared to earlier examination of a ct scan of the cervical spine. comminuted fracture of the c2 vertebral body is again visualized. there is loss of the vertebral body height at this level and fragments are displaced inferoposteriorly causing moderate central canal stenosis at the level of c2-3 with mild cord compression. the spinal cord at this level is swollen and has abnormal increased t2 and central susceptiblity signal suggesting the presence of cord edema and hemorrhage, with the edema extending from the level of c2 to the c3-4 level. the remaining of the vertebral bodies are well aligned with no spondylolysis nor spondylolisthesis. there is fracture of the distal spinous process of c3. no other fractures are visualized. prevertebral soft tissue swelling is noted. the epidural hemorrhage that was suggested on ct scan is not as well visualized on the present mri examination.
the anterior listhesis of c5 on c6 appears to have increased by 2 to 3 millimeters when compared to the prior study. the cord demonstrates abnormal signal in this area. there is fluid located in the prevertebral, and soft tissue space posterior to this level. this may be consistent with hemorrhage.
the study is very limited because of poor patient cooperation. in particular, the axial images are especially difficult to interpret. overall, there is normal alignment of the cervical spine. thickening of the ligamentum flavum consistent with degenerative change is seen particularly from c2 through c6. at c2-c3, there is a small disc osteophyte complex but no spinal stenosis or foraminal narrowing. however, at c3-c4, there is encroachment of a disc osteophyte complex into the spinal canal associated with mild to moderate spinal stenosis. at c4-c5 and c5-c6, there is a moderate to severe spinal stenosis associated with disc osteophyte complexes and evidence of bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. at higher levels, there is no obvious foraminal narrowing, although the axial images are of limited utility. at c6- c7, there is a small degree of osteophytosis but no stenosis or foraminal narrowing. in particular, there is no evidence of cord compromise in the region of the c7 facet fracture. the spinal stenosis seen at high levels is related to degenerative changes. there is no subluxation of the component vertebrae. the visualized spinal cord, foramen magnum, and its contents are unremarkable. the surrounding soft tissues appear normal to the extent visualized.
comparison is made to outside hospital mri examination.
there has been resolution of previously identified soft tissue fluid collection since the previous study. the patient has undergone extensive laminectomy for drainage of epidural abscess from c3 to the thoracic region, as described previously. there are mild soft tissue changes with enhancement, indicating postoperative changes and inflammation of the soft tissues, predominantly to the left of midline. there is no evidence of a residual epidural abscess identified. there is no evidence of spinal cord compression seen. the spinal cord demonstrates normal intrinsic signal. mild degenerative changes are noted in the cervical region. in the thoracic region mild multilevel degenerative changes are identified.
there is no evidence of subluxation. there is fluid in the posterior nasopharynx. the inversion recovery images demonstrate no evidence of abnormal signal intensity in the spinal ligaments to suggest an acute ligamentous injury. the sensitivity of this technique for detecting ligamentous injury is known. there are degenerative changes in the cervical spine with osteophytes extending posteriorly from the intervertebral joints at c4-5, ___ and ___. thickening of the ligamentum flavum at these levels contributes to spinal canal narrowing. at c5-6, disc osteophyte is larger on the left than right and narrows the left neural foramen, in addition to flattening the anterior and left side of the spinal cord. at c6-7, although the osteophyte is large, there is no evidence of cord compression. the area of possible mediastinal hematoma described on the ct scan is not well evaluated on this study.
there is marked artifact limiting evaluation in the thoracic region. sagittal images through the cervical spine reveal no cord compression. there is decreased signal intensity in the t9 and 10 vertebrae, perhaps related to previous infection, though there is expected to be increased signal intensity reflecting edema, if there is ongoing infection in these bones. there is slightly greater t2 signal hyperintensity in the t7-8 intervertebral disc than other upper thoracic discs, but the significance of this finding is unknown. lumbosacral images reveal no compression of the cauda equina. there are degenerative changes. the bones and discs cannot be adequately evaluated for infection.
there is considerable retropulsion of bone fragments at the site of the l1 compression and burst fracture with considerable canal compromise at the level of what is probably the conus or proximal cauda equina. there is an associated epidural hematoma posterior to the vertebral bodies. there is paravertebral hematoma visualized anteriorly as well. the remaining vertebrae are intact. disc spaces are preserved. there is no evidence of focal disc protrusion or canal stenosis at any additional level. there is a considerable presacral fluid collection, raising the question of fracture in the region of the distal sacrum and coccyx, not visualized on either the mr ___ ___.
vertebral bodies are normal in height and alignment, and demonstrate normal signal intensity. there is a convex left thoracolumbar scoliosis. at l2/3, there is a mild diffuse posterior disc bulge, which partially flattens the thecal sac, but does not cause spinal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing. at l3/4, there is a mild to moderate broad-based posterior disc bulge, which partially flattens the thecal sac, and causes mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. there is also moderate compression both l4 nerve root sleeves. at l4/5, there are fatty end-plate changes on both sides of the intervertebral disc. there is a large broad-based posterior bulge, which causes mild spinal stenosis, and mild narrowing of the right neural foramen, and moderately severe narrowing of the left neural foramen. there is severe compression of the left l4 nerve as it exits the foramen, as well as mild compression of the left l5 nerve root sleeve. at l5/s1, there is a moderate posterior disc bulge, which indents the thecal sac, but does not cause spinal stenosis. there is moderate compression of both s1 nerve root sleeves and mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing.
there is no evidence of abnormal signal, including stir sequences, within the dens to suggest fracture. however, mr is limited in the detection of fractures and correlation with studies done at the outside hospital are therefore necessary. there is increased t2 and stir intensity within the c1- c2 facet joints bilaterally which may represent fluid secondary to traumatic injury. there is also a central disc protrusion at c3-4 causing mild to moderate neural foraminal narrowing bilaterally with no definite evidence of canal stenosis. there is no abnormal signal intensity within the visualized spinal cord. there is no evidence of a chiari malformation. there appears to be a fluid containing structure within the region of the vein of ___ with impression upon the superior aspect of the cerebellar vermis as described on a prior head ct.

comparison is made to the mri of the c-spine from ___. study is limited by significant patient motion. allowing for this limitation, there is no cord compression. there is slight increased t2 signal within the spinal cord, which is unchanged since the prior study. there is a moderate sized posterior paraspinal fluid collection, which contacts the dorsal dural surface, as seen on prior ct scan, with enhancement of the surrounding tissues, and in the dura. these findings could be normal postoperative findings, but the fluid pocket could also be infected. furthermore, there is possibly subtle enhancement of the dorsal cord surface at the level of the postsurgical defect and extending slightly cranially. this could also represent inflammatory changes, possibly due to infection. no definite gas bubbles are seen within the fluid collection. there are foci of increased susceptability within the postsurgical bed soft tissues. no surgical clips or air bubbles are seen on ct. these foci likely do not represent gas bubbles, since the interval since the ct scan is too short for their development. the findings likely represent small metallic fragments, too small to be seen on ct, but large enough to give surrounding susceptibility artifact on mri. there is faint increased signal intensity within the c5 and c6 vertebral bodies on stir sequences, which may represent postsurgical change. there is extensive signal hyperintensity on stir sequences associated with the paraspinal fluid collection and the surrounding soft tissues.
from the skull base to t4 level the vertebral bodies demonstrate normal signal and there is no evidence of marrow edema or fracture identified. there is no evidence of vertebral mal-alignment. the ligamentous structures in the cervical region demonstrate no evidence of abnormal signal. there is no evidence of epidural hematoma or spinal cord compression. there is no evidence of intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities. extensive soft tissue changes are seen in the posterior soft tissues in the upper thoracic region indicating soft tissue trauma. there is fluid within the nasopharynx and oropharynx which could be secondary to intubation. mucosal thickening is seen in the sphenoid sinus.

there is normal alignment of the vertebral bodies; there is no loss of height of the vertebral bodies or vertebral discs. within the left aspect of l3, a t1 and t2 hyperintense hemangioma is unchanged in size and appearance. the l1/2 and l3 levels remain normal. there is mild disc dessication between levels l3 and s1, unchanged from prior study. the l3/l4 level is stable in appearance and morphology. at l4/5 a broad disc bulge is again identified, slightly more prominent to the right. no significant neural foraminal narrowing is identified. at l5/s1, a central disc protrusion is seen associated with a small annular tear. in comparison with prior study, this protrusion is smaller in ap dimension and has less of a leftward extension. this disc contacts, but does not appear to compress the left s1 nerve root. contact with the right s1 nerve root is also demonstrated without compression. no neural foraminal narrowing is identified.
the fluid space at the level of c7-t1 extending into the left neural foramen is again identified consistent with root avulsion with subsequent pseudocyst formation. on the sagittal and axial t1-weighted sequences there is a focus of increased contrast enhancement posteriorly at the level of c6 which raises the question whether this represents a root avulsion injury in this location. there is no evidence of abnormality in the region of the upper cervical spine. the gd mra of the cervical spine was apparently not performed at this time. this will be rescheduled and performed subsequently.
at the craniocervical junction there are soft tissue changes at the atlanto-dentoid joint both anteriorly and posteriorly. the findings indicate inflammatory pannus. there is narrowing of the spinal canal at this level with compression of spinal cord. the t2 and inversion recovery images demonstrate mild increased signal within the spinal cord at this level indicating cord edema/myelomalacia. at c2-3, c3-4 and c4-5 level disc and uncovertebral degenerative changes. at c3-4, c4-5 mild to moderate bilateral foraminal canal narrowing is seen. at c7-t1 degenerative changes are noted with mild frontal narrowing. inferior to there is no evidence of increased signal within the vertebral bodies on inversion recovery images to indicate marrow edema or mild compression fracture. no evidence of abnormal signal seen within the ligamentous structures on inversion recovery images.
there is disc desiccation at all visualized lumbar levels. there is mild generalized disc bulging with a small central annular tear at l5-s1. there is no evidence of focal disc protrusion. there is no evidence of canal or foraminal stenosis. there is no evidence of a paravertebral mass. the marrow signal is preserved.
vertebral body height and alignment is normal. normal marrow signal intensity is appreciated. there is a well- delineated central disk invagination consistent with a schmorl's node involving the inferior endplate of the l2 vertebral body. the conus ends at the l1 level and is normal in signal intensity and appearance. at l3-4, there is mild spinal canal stenosis secondary to diffuse disk bulge. no neuroforaminal narrowing is seen. at l4-l5, there is severe central canal stenosis secondary to diffuse disk bulge, facet proliferative change, and hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum. moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis is also seen at this level. at l5-s1, there is no spinal canal stenosis or neuroforaminal compromise. facet proliferative changes are noted at this level. note is made of a 3.8-cm right renal exophytic cyst. also, there is a small focus of elevated signal intensity on both t1 and t2-weighted images involving the left kidney posteriorly. this may represent a proteinaceous cyst, but evaluation is limited.
from skull base to t4 level, no evidence of abnormal signal seen within the vertebral bodies or ligamentous structures. the prevertebral soft tissues are maintained. there is no evidence of intraspinal fluid collection seen. mild degenerative changes are seen in the cervical region from t3-4 to t6-7 level. evaluation for foramina is limited on axial images secondary to artifacts. at c4 level to the right of midline, small area of increased signal is seen on the spinal cord on t2 and inversion recovery sagittal images. this could be secondary to intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormality. this could also be secondary to an artifact as the examinations are limited by pulsations. if the patient has myelopathic signs, consider a repeat study with sedation.
there is a large mass seen arising from the t1 vertebral body, completely replacing and collapsing the vertebral body, left pedicle and transverse process, crossing the midline in both the anterior and posterior aspects, and surrounding but not compressing the spinal cord, which retains normal signal characteristics at this level. otherwise, vertebral body alignment is satisfactory. there are degenerative changes at several levels in the cervical spine.
there is accentuated flexion of the cervical spine. there is no signal abnormality within the cervical vertebral bodies. there is normal alignment of the posterior aspects of the cervical vertebral bodies. the cervical spine is grossly within normal limits. on the axial images there is no significant degenerative changes at the c3-4 level. at c4-5 there is a central disc osteophyte complex and bilateral uncovertebral joint degenerative changes which results in mild central canal stenosis and mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. at c5-6 there is a central disc osteophyte complex and bilateral uncovertebral joint degenerative changes which result in moderate central canal and moderate bilateral neural foraminal narrowing at this level. at c6-7 there are mild uncovertebral joint degenerative changes without central canal or neural foraminal narrowing. there are no significan degenerative changes at the c7-t1 level.
from c2 through c5, no spinal stenosis and no neural foraminal narrowing is seen. at c5-6, there is mild left-sided neural foraminal narrowing due to disc-osteophyte complex. there is wavy appearance of nuchal ligament with adjacent area of edema, raising question of ligamentous tear. recommend flexion and extension views for better evaluation of this area. there is apparent increased signal in the paravertebral space anterior to c1 and c2 vertebral bodies raising the question of ligamentous injury vs. collection of oral and nasal mucosal secretion secondary to patient's intubated state. there is a subdural hematoma extending along the tentorium cerebelli.
no disc or vertebral pathology is seen. there is no spinal stenosis or subluxation of the component vertebrae. the visualized spinal cord, foramen magnum, and its contents are unremarkable. there is a 2.0 x 1.8 cm area of hyperintensity on both t1 and t2w images within the left thyroid lobe. this could be a hemorrhagic lesion or contain high protein.
no significant disc, spinal cord, or paraspinal abnormality is seen in the sagittal planes. axial planes, specifically looking at multiple vertebral levels, show no evidence of disc, spinal cord, or paraspinal pathology.
vertebral body alignment is satisfactory. artifact from anterior cervical fusion hardware is seen within the regions of c3 through c7 vertebral bodies. there is a small amount of high signal indicating fluid within the posterior oropharynx. the foramen magnum and its contents and the spinal cord itself are normal in signal. at c2-3 interspace, no disk, vertebral body, or paraspinal pathology is seen. at c3-4 interspace, artifact mars the image somewhat, however, a disk osteophyte complex is seen indenting the thecal sac and causing moderate bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. at c4-5, artifact is seen within the vertebral body; a disk osteophyte complex is seen causing mild bilateral foraminal narrowing. at c5-6, artifact is seen within the vertebral body. there is mild bilateral foraminal narrowing from a disk osteophyte complex. at c6-7, artifact is seen within the vertebral body. a disk osteophyte complex is seen narrowing the spinal canal, with bilateral (right greater than left) neural foraminal narrowing. in the spinal canal, there is complete loss of t2 signal around the cord, indicating severe stenosis, however, there is no abnormal signal intensity within the cord. at c7-1 no disk, vertebral body, or paraspinal abnormality is seen.
the alignment of the cervical spine is unremarkable. the vertebral body heights are preserved, and no bone marrow signal abnormalities are identified. there are no findings to suggest fracture. incidental note is made of fluid within the sphenoid sinus. multilevel degenerative changes are present. at c5/6, there is a broad-based disc-osteophyte complex, which causes mild narrowing of the spinal canal, as well as the neural foramina at this level. at c6/7, there is a broad-based disc-osteophyte complex, which causes mild narrowing of the spinal canal, as well as the neural foramina bilaterally. there is no evidence of a ligamentous injury. however, mri has been shown to be insensitive in the evaluation of ligamentous injuries.
note is made of a compression fracture of the t5 vertebral body. there is no evidence of spinal cord compression. there is minimal increased t2 signal of this t5 vertebral body, which may indicate a small amount of edema. otherwise, the vertebral bodies, paraspinal region, and disk spaces are normal. there is no evidence of an enhancing mass. the spinal cord is normal in appearance. incidental note is made of the known mucosal thickening within the sphenoid sinus.
there is no abnormal increased signal in the posterior aspect of the cervical spine in the region of the interspinous ligaments. in addition, no abnormal signal within the anterior portion of the spine is present. the spinal cord itself could not be optimally evaluated due to patient motion. the vertebral bodies and the vertebral discs and cervical alignment are unremarkable. review of the ct scan performed on ___ and the current mri of the cervical spine, reveals mild narrowing of the right neural foramen at l5-s1 level caused by disc osteophyte complex.
vertebral alignment is satisfactory. the foramen magnum and its contents, and the spinal cord are unremarkable. at c3-4, there is mild uncovertebral spurring, causing mild right neural foraminal narrowing. no spinal stenosis is seen. at c4-5, there is also mild uncovertebral spurring, causing mild right neural foraminal narrowing. no spinal stenosis is seen. at c5-6, there is a disc osteophyte complex causing bilateral mild neural foraminal narrowing. no spinal stenosis is seen. at c6-7, there is a disc osteophyte complex causing mild to moderate spinal canal stenosis, along with bilateral mild to moderate neural foraminal narrowing. at c7-1, no neural foraminal or spinal canal stenosis is seen.
compared to the previous examination, there is decreased abnormal signal within the cervical cord, largely confined to the region of c3 and c4. there does not appear to be abnormal cord swelling at the present time. there is still some contrast enhancement but this also appears to be reduced compared to the previous examination. degenerative disease is again seen involving c3- c4, c4-c5, and c5-c6, and c6-c7 essentially unchanged compared to the previous examination. for details, see that report.
there is normal vertebral body height and alignment, with scattered hemangiomas. there is desiccation of the discs from l2 through s1. there are tiny disc bulges at each of these levels resulting in mild right neural foraminal narrowing at l2-3, minimal left neural foraminal narrowing at l3-4, and mild left neural foraminal narrowing at l4-5. there is no nerve root impingement or spinal canal narrowing. minimal focal high t2 signal adjacent to the right and left nerve roots in the l3-4 neural foramina entry zones bilaterally most likely represent small perineural cysts. subtle areas of t2 signal abnormality are seen within the left inferior facet at l2 and the right inferior facet at l4. this represents mild facet arthropathy. a 4 mm ovoid well-circsumcribed high t2 focus in the right l4 articular facet is noted -- this is of uncertain etiology, but most likely represents an atypical synovial cyst.
sagittal images demonstrate normal vertebral alignment. there are mild signal abnormalities in some of the vertebrae, along the endplate margins, indicative of degenerative change. this is most pronounced at c6-7. there is no evidence of edema within the vertebral bodies on the inversion recovery images. on the t2-weighted images, there is a tiny focus, not more than 1 cm in size, of hyperintensity at the most posterior extent of the c7 spinous process. a fracture cannot be clearly identified in this location on this ct scan. the nature of this finding is uncertain. the adjacent soft tissues do not appear disrupted or edematous. as noted on the cervical spine ct, there is a small amount of subdural blood in the superior cervical spinal canal, posterior to the cord. there is no compression. axial images demonstrate disc osteophyte complexes along the endplates at multiple levels. at c3-4, this results in mild spinal canal narrowing and moderate bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. at c4-5, there is also mild canal stenosis and moderate to severe right neural foraminal narrowing and moderate left neural foraminal narrowing. at c5-6, endplate osteophytes indent the thecal sac and produce moderate spinal canal stenosis as well as neural foraminal narrowing. at c6-7, there is also mild to moderate spinal stenosis and moderate bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. at c7-t1, the spinal canal and neural foramina do not appear significantly narrowed. cervical spinal cord signal is normal.
lumbar spine mri: the conus terminates at t12-l1. l2-l3: this level is incompletely imaged on the axial sequences. on the sagittal images, there is no evidence of central canal stenosis. l3-l4: there is mild diffuse disc bulge, and mild left neuroforaminal narrowing. there is no right neuroforaminal or central canal stenosis. l4-l5: there is mild diffuse disc bulge and disc desiccation. there is mild to moderate bilateral neuroforaminal narrowing. there is no central canal narrowing. l5-s1: there is mild diffuse disc bulge, and a tiny focal posterior protrusion. there is mild ro moderate left neural foraminal narrowing. the right neuroforamen and central canal are not narrowed. there is bilateral facet hypertrophy. probable spina bifida occult at l5. no pars defect is identified.
sagittal scans demonstrate normal cervical vertebral alignment. vertebral body height is maintained. there is a tiny focus of increased t2 and t1 signal in the superior aspect of t4, which was present previously and may represent a hemangioma. inversion recovery images reveal no bone edema and there is no edema of the prevertebral soft tissue or posterior cervical soft tissues. axial images demonstrate a wide spinal canal and wide neural foramina at all levels. no disc herniations are observed.
the spinal canal is widely patent throughout the cervical region. there is no abnormal signal within the cord. no abnormal bone marrow signal is present. the anterior longitudinal ligament is discontinuous at c4-5. osteophytes are present in this location, as seen on prior cervical spine ct. no abnormal signal is demonstrated on the t2 or stir sequences, which suggests this is chronic. no anbormalities are seen within the ligaments at any other level. there is fluid within the posterior pharynx. mild edema is present within the posterior pharygneal wall. this is a nonspecific finding and may be due to endotracheal tube insertion/instrumentation. no neural foraminal narrowing is present at any level.
at the craniocervical junction and from c2-3 and c3-4 mild degenerative changes are noted. at c4-5 there is mild anterolisthesis of c4 over c5 secondary to facet degenerative changes. at c5-6 and c6-7 mild bulging and uncovertebral degenerative changes are seen. at c7-t1 and inferiorly to t4-5 disc degenerative changes are noted. at the visualized levels no evidence of abnormal signal is seen within the vertebral bodies or ligamentous structures. mild soft tissue edema is seen posteriorly in the lower cervical and upper thoracic region. the evaluation for spinal cord signal changes is limited secondary to motion artifacts, but no obvious abnormalities are seen.
sagittal images demonstrate an anterolisthesis of l4 with respect to l5. there is a degenerative protrusion of the intervening disk. there is also facet degenerative change at this level and ligamentous thickening. the combination of these findings produces severe spinal stenosis. there is the appearance of redundancy of the nerve roots superior to this level. there are mild degenerative changes of the l2-3 and l3-4 intervertebral disks, without canal or foraminal narrowing at these levels. the l5-s1 disk space appears normal. the conus is in normal position. there is a focus of t1 and t2 hyperintensity within the l2 vertebral body which probably represents a hemangioma. a tiny hemangioma or focus of fat is also present in the s1 body.
the vertebrae and the disc spaces are normal in size, normal in height, signal intensity and alignment. the spinal cord is unremarkable. no abnormal enhancing lesions noted.
there is a prominent amount of phase encoding artifact in the cervical spine. however, there is no evidence of an abnormal epidural collection or mass effect on the thecal sac or cervical spinal cord. the marrow signal and alignment of the cervical vertebrae is unremarkable. the cervicomedullary junction is unremarkable. there is a prominent csf space in the posterior fossa, which is stable and has been described on the prior head ct dated ___ and on the brain mri performed at the same time as this total spine mri. there is no anbormal enhancement in the cervical spine.
no prevertebral fluid collections are present. the collections seen on earlier cervical mri of ___ is not present. there is no spondylolisthesis. the signal within the bone marrow is preserved on all pulse sequences. no spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing is present. there is normal spinal cord signal. no paravertebral soft tissue signal abnormalities are present. there are no enhancing lesions.
no signal-intensity abnormalities are identified within the osseous structures, spinal canal, or spinal cord. there is normal vertebral body height and alignment. there is a minimal disc bulge at the c6-7 level without evidence of spinal canal narrowing. cerebellar tonsilar position and visualized midbrain are normal in appearance. the soft tissues are unremarkable.
again, and old type 2 fracture of the odontoid process is noted with postoperative changes. at c2-3 and c3-4 mild degenerative changes are noted. from c4-5, c5-6 and c6-7 there is posterior ridging and disc-osteophyte complexes visualized. mild narrowing of the spinal canal is seen at c4-5 and moderate narrowing of the spinal canal is seen at c5-6 and c6-7 with mild extrinsic indentation. no evidence of intrinsic spinal cord signal anbormalities is seen. at c7-t1 and inferiorly to t4-5 degenerative disc disease is seen. there is no evidence of abnormal ligamentous or bony signal seen. mild soft tissue prominence in the prevertebral soft tissues at the craniocervical junction could be related to previous surgery. there is no evidence of disruption of the ligamentous structures seen.
an linear area of low signal is identified in the c2 vertebra indicative of known displaced fracture seen by the ct. at c3-4 level, there is retrolisthesis of c3 over c4 seen with widening of the anterior portion of the intervertebral disc with increased signal within the disc. there is increased signal seen within the intraspinous ligaments at this level. there appears to be disruption of the posterior longitudinal ligament. at c4-5 and c5-6, no abnormalities are identified. at c6-7, there is widening of the intervertebral disc with increased signal within the disc due to fracture dislocation. there is disruption of the posterior longitudinal and intraspinous ligaments. prevertebral hematomas are identified at the craniocervical junction to c4 level and also at c6-7 level. there is high grade compression of the spinal cord seen at c3-4 level with an area of low signal within the spinal cord indicating hemorrhage at this level. there is edema extending both superiorly and inferiorly within the spinal cord. at c6-7 moderate spinal cord compression is seen. no definite evidence of increased signal is seen within the spinal cord at this level.
the patient has undergone anterior fusion from c4 through c6. additionally there is hardware posteriorly at approximately c5 through c7 although these levels are difficult to ascertain on the mr posteriorly. on the t2-weighted and inversion recovery-weighted sequences there is high signal within the cervical spinal cord at the c5 level. this is not significantly changed from the prior study and could represent cord edema or gliosis. there is extensive high t2 signal in the subcutaneous and deep tissues of the neck posteriorly with a small focal fluid collection without a well-defined rim. these are consistent with post-operative changes from the surgical fusion. there is high signal tracking along all the paraspinal muscles and ligaments. with the exception of the surgically fused cervical vertebral bodies there are no areas of signal abnormality within the cervical and upper thoracic vertebral bodies. on the axial images at c4-5 there is mild central canal stenosis with effacement of the spinal cord posteriorly. at c5-6 there is severe central canal narrowing which measures 5 mm in ap dimension. the spinal cord is circumferentially effaced at this level and no csf is seen surrounding the spinal cord. at c6-7 the central canal is not narrowed. the signal within the spinal cord is difficult to evaluate on the axial images due to the severe spinal stenosis. again there is edema in the prevertebral soft tissues also related to injury and the patient's surgery. there is high signal within the paranasal sinuses consistent with fluid. again seen in the upper portion of the t2-weighted sagittal images there is stable high signal within the pons. compared to the prior examination there has been interval placement of surgical hardware and there is persistent severe spinal canal narrowing at the c5-6 level.
there is increased t2 signal in the c3 to 4 intervertebral disk with associated increased signal in the marrow of the vertebral bodies of c3 and c4. there is enhancement in these regions on the post- contrast images. there is associated prevertebral soft tissue swelling which also demonstrates enhancement on the post-contrast images. these findings are consistent with diskitis and osteomyelitis of the c3 to 4 intervertebral disk and adjacent vertebral bodies. the infectious process extends into the paravertebral space as well as the epidural space. there is enhancement in the epidural space extending both cranially and caudally from the c3-4 disk level. the spinal canal is narrowed at c3 to 4, but the cord is not compressed. there is also enhancing soft tissue signal in the neural foramina at c3-4, c4- 5, and c5-6. in the prevertebral space, there is enhancing soft tissue infiltrating the longus ___ muscles as well as extending laterally to involve the paraspinal muscles and neural foramina. this enhancing inflammatory soft tissue also abuts the posterior aspect of the right common carotid artery. there is no focal fluid collection. these findings are all consistent with an infiltrative infectious process eminating from the diskitis at c3 to 4. at c5-6, there may be a left paracentral disk protrusion which causes some mild to moderate narrowing of the left neural foramen.
again seen is the anterior subluxation of c4 on c5 with a locked right facet and a perched left facet. the anterior longitudinal, posterior longitudinal and interspinous ligaments are torn at this level. there is edema in the c4/5 disc, which is protruding posteriorly. the spinal cord at the level of the injury is compressed by the disc and by an epidural hematoma, which is widest at c4/5 but extends from c2 to c7. there is faint increased t2 signal in the spinal cord at c4/5, consistent with edema. there is also a large prevertebral hematoma extending from c1 to c4/5. there is edema in the soft tissues adjacent to the posterior elements, most prominent at the level of the injury but also extending several adjacent levels. at c5/6, there are uncovertebral osteophytes and a right-sided disc protrusion flattening the right ventrolateral aspect of the spinal cord. this report is redictated on ___ because the initial dictation was lost. the findings were communicated to dr. ___ at the time of interpretation in the morning of ___.
the c1 thru t2 vertebral bodies are visualized. no signal abnormalities are identified to suggest fracture or bony abnormality. in the region of lucency in the left aspect of the c1 ring seen on the ct scan, no signal abnormalities are identified on the mri. the vertebral bodies are normal in height and alignment. the disc display normal signal intensity. the spinal column is normal in caliber with no evidence of disc protrusions. the spinal cord demonstrates normal signal intensity without evidence of compression. the soft tissues are unremarkable.
the patient is status post thoracolumbar fusion with pedicle screws in the l3 vertebral body. the vertical fusion rods extend upward to the t10 level. there have been laminectomies at l2, l3, l5 and a laminotomy at s1. there is bridging graft material extending from t10 through the sacrum. at the l4-5 intervertebral disc space, there is a collection currently composed of relatively homogeneous high ___ internal content, with a surrounding slightly thickened rim of enhancement. the craniocaudad thickness of this collection has not changed significantly since the prior mr or since the ct, though on today's scan there is a focal contiguous extension from the collection into the soft tissues anterior to the disc space on the left, which is new. on the ct scan there was an air- fluid level -- no air is seen within the collection at this time, but air may be more difficult to identify by mri. additionally on the prior mr, there was heterogeneous signal within the collection with low signal internal stranding -- however now the collection is more homogeneous in appearance. there is nonspecific edema and enhancement in the adjoining portion of both psoas muscles, but-- allowing for the contiguous "tongue" of fluid extending from the disc space, described above -- no separate focal abcess collection is detected. no epidural collection is identified. as noted, there is enhancement along the posterior perpihery of the collection, which extends into the anterior aspect ofthe spinal canal. in comparison to the ___ mri, the contours of the vertebral bodies are slightly different, the cortex along the anterosuperior aspect of l5 vertebral is focally not seen, and there is abnormal low t1/high t2 signal in the marrow abutting the endplates -- this may very well be accounted for by the most recent surgery, though the ddx includes changes due to osteomyelitis. the bone graft anterior to the disc space seen on the ___ ct is presumably present, but difficult to appreciate by mri because of differences in the two modalities. in evaluating the alignment of the lumbar spine, the l4 vertebral body on some images appears to have rotated slightly posteriorly in relation to the l3 vertebral body. this is only seen on some images and may be due to worsening scoliosis or positioning. there has been further disc desiccation and loss of disc height at the l3-4 level. this may account for the apparent change in alignment. there is disc desiccation at all levels. on the axial images at t11-12 there is a small left paracentral disc bulge which abuts the thecal sac but does not cause central canal narrowing. there is mild narrowing of the left neural foramen. at t12-l1 there is a broad based disc bulge without evidence of central neural foraminal narrowing. at l1-2 there is a grade 1 retrolisthesis and scoliosis. there is no central canal narrowing. there is bilateral moderate neural foraminal narrowing. at l2-3 there is disc desiccation. artifact from pedicle screws obscures the neural foramen. there is no central canal narrowing. at l3-4, the is distortion due to the scoliosis, with grade i anterolisthesis. there is no central canal narrowing. there is mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. there is disc desiccation and probable vacuum disc phenomenon. there is fluid within the right facet joint. at l4-5, there is severe central canal stenosis. ossific material is present posteriorly (see also ___ ct scan) and the posterior elements of the l4 vertebral body appear to be present. the central canal stenosis is caused by a combination of facet degenerative changes and facet arthropathy and as well as the enhancing posterior rim of the material within the disc space. there is moderate narrowing of both neural foramina at this level. the details of the signal abnormality within the l4-5 disc space are described above. the spinal canal stenosis may be slightly more pronounced than on the ___ mri. at l5-s1 there is a broad based disc bulge without significant central canal narrowing. there is mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing due to facet arthropathy. in evaluation of the thecal sac, there is no clumping of nerve roots to suggest arachnoiditis. as mentioned earlier, no epidural collection is identified. in the extraspinal structures, there is a hiatal hernia. the common bile duct is dilated, measuring 1 cm. this was seen on prior chest ct from ___. there is edema and high t2 signal in lung posteriorly, seen at the edge of the field of view. on the axial images, there is irregularity of the left iliac bone with a small rim- enhancing fluid collection in the overlying (superficial) soft tissues -- this should be correlated clinically to confirm that it represents the donor site for the patient's spinal bone graft.
there is significant motion artifact on the sagittal stir images, limiting the sensitivity for detection of a ligamentous injury. no ligamentous disruption is identified on this study. the alignment of the cervical spine is within normal limits. the vertebral body heights are preserved, and no bone marrow signal abnormalities are identified. at c5-6 level, there is a posterior osteophyte which mildly impresses upon the spinal cord. no spinal cord signal abnormalities are identified.
there is an oblique fracture through the c5 vertebral body with retropulsion of the major fracture fragment into the spinal canal causing severe spinal stenosis at this level. the cervical spinal cord at c5 has increased t2 signal within it, consistent with cord edema. there is also subtle signal irregularity on a sagittal gre scan centrally within the cord, and it is difficult to exclude cord contusion. there is prevertebral soft tissue swelling. a high t2 signal gap in the anterior longitudinal ligament at c5 is consistent with a tear. there is also increased signal in the interspinous ligaments spanning from c2 to c5. these findings are all consistent with an unstable fracture. at the edge of the image field of view, there is increased signal in the pons on the sagittal t2 weighted images. the pons and the rest of the brain are not fully seen on this study and a brain mri is recommended for further evaluation.
alignment of the cervical vertebral bodies is normal without evidence of listhesis. there is increased t2 and stir signal demonstrated within the prevertebral soft tissues anterior to the c4 through c7 levels. no abnormal signal is demonstrated within the osseous structures. there is no loss of vertebral body height. at the c3-4 level, there is a large left paracentral disc protrusion present which indents the ventral aspect of the thecal sac and causes severe spinal stenosis and moderate narrowing of the left neural foramen. the right neural foramen is patent. at the c4-5 level, there is a left-sided disc protrusion present which indents upon the ventral aspect of the thecal sac, resulting in severe spinal stenosis and severe narrowing of both neural foramina. at the c5-6 level, there is a broad-based disc bulge present which results in severe spinal stenosis and flattening of the ventral aspect of the thecal sac. additionally, there is severe left neural foraminal narrowing and moderate right neural foraminal narrowing. at the c6-7 level, there is a right paracentral disc protrusion present which indents upon the ventral aspect of the thecal sac resulting in moderate central canal stenosis and moderate right neural foraminal narrowing. the left neural foramen is patent. the spinal cord is normal in signal intensity. foramen magnum and its contents are unremarkable. the airway appears patent throughout.
the alignment of the cervical spine is normal. the marrow signal is normal. the disc heights are preserved. there is no fracture or ligamentous injury. the cord signal is normal. there is questionable tracking of hemorrhage posterior to the upper cervical cord from the brain.
alignment of the cervical spine is normal. the spinal cord appears normal in caliber, configuration and signal intensity. there are no areas of bone edema detected to suggest acute fractures. there is no evidence of ligamentous injury on this mr examination. please note that the sensitivity of the mr for detecting significant ligamentous injury is unknown. there are degenerative changes at c5-6 and c6-7 with loss of disc space height and osteophyte formation. axial images reveal no significant abnormalities from c2 through c4. at c5-6, intervertebral osteophyte formation narrows the spinal canal and touches the ventral surface of the spinal cord. however, csf is present surrounding the spinal cord. there is moderate bilateral neural foraminal narrowing due to uncovertebral osteophyte formation. at c6-7 small intervertebral osteophytes slightly narrow the spinal canal with no encroachment on the spinal cord. the neural foramina appear normal. axial images from c7 through upper t2 reveal no significant abnormalities.
sagittal images of the cervicothoracic spine demonstrate further compression of the t5 vertebrae with retropulsion of the vertebral fragments into the spinal canal. there appears to be cord compression at this level. the axial images are somewhat blurred due to motion artifact. there is also foraminal narrowing bilaterally. otherwise, cervical and thoracic vertebral height is maintained and there are no focal signal abnormalities identified within the bones. lumbosacral sagittal images demonstrate bony signal abnormality in the l3 vertebrae and some compression deformity of this bone. there is slight posterior bulging of the l3 vertebral body with flattening of the ventral thecal sac and some canal narrowing but no neural compression. anterior to the lumbar spine, surrounding the aorta, there is extensive lymphadenopathy. some of this extraspinal soft tissue mass may extend into the spinal canal but this cannot be assessed on the images which were obtained, primarily due to patient motion and limits of technique. findings in the lumbar spine are roughly the same as on the previous study, however, there is slightly greater compression deformity of the l3 vertebral bodies than there was on the previous study.
the inversion recovery images are limited secondary to patient motion. the alignment of the cervical vertebral bodies is normal without evidence of listhesis. within the c6 vertebral body, there is a central area of diffuse increased t2 and stir signal demonstrated, consistent with a bone contusion. there is no loss of vertebral body or disk height. signal intensity values of the remaining intervertebral disks and vertebral bodies is otherwise normal. there is no evidence of spinal stenosis, neural foraminal narrowing, or disk herniation. pre-vertebral soft tissues are normal in signal intensity. there is fluid demonstrated within the pharynx, and an endotracheal tube is in place. the signal intensity of the spinal cord is normal. the foramen magnum and its contents are unremarkable.
some of the sequences are limited by patient motion. the vertebral body height and alignment is normal. bone marrow signal, however, appears diffusely abnormal, which is concerning for leukemic infiltration. the spinal cord is normal in contour, and no significant abnormalities are identified within the cord. there are no foci of abnormal enhancement. there are no masses in the central canal, and no canal stenosis. the findings were discussed with dr. ___ at 1:30 p.m. on ___.
at t10-11 and t11-12 disc degenerative changes are seen. the t12 vertebra demonstrates mild chronic compression. from t12-l1 to l5-s1 level disc degenerative changes are seen with disc bulging. at l2-3 level there is moderate diffuse disc bulge with thickening of the ligaments resulting in mild to moderate spinal stenosis. at l3-4 mild spinal stenosis is seen. at l4-5 mild spinal stenosis is identified. the distal spinal cord shows normal signal intensities. note is made of decreased signal within the s2 portions of the s2 segment of the sacrum with decreased linear signal on axial images through both ala sacrum consistent with insufficiency fractures.
the vertebral bodies are well maintained. the bone marrow signal intensity is normal. there is scoliosis, convex to the right inferiorly. sagittal images show minimal disc-space osteophyte formation at c4-5 and c5-6. there is no flattening of the spinal cord or significant foraminal stenosis. the other imaged levels are unremarkable. the spinal cord is of normal size and signal intensity. a prominent cisterna magna, a normal variation, is noted. the craniovertebral junction is otherwise unremarkable.
there is substantial motion artifact on the cervical spine images, particularly the sagittal t1w images. the alignment of the cervical spine appears to be within normal limits. the vertebral body heights are preserved. there is a band of increased signal intensity on t2w images within the retropharyngeal space. it is not clear whether this represents fluid related to trauma or if this is fluid within the esophagus. at the c7-t1 level, there is a focal area of increased signal intensity adjacent to the right neural foramen. this may represent a nerve root diverticulum. however, a nerve root avulsion cannot be excluded. there is a burst fracture of the l1 vertebral body with posterior retropulsion of fracture framents. the conus medullaris is at the level of l1. the fragments appear to efface the thecal sac, without severe compression at this level.
the diastasis of the left si joint seen on previous radiographs has been reduced. susceptibility artifact in the region of the left si joint represents fixation hardware and limits evaluation of this region. at the l1-l3 levels: there is no disc bulge or herniation. no central canal or neural foraminal stenosis. at the l3-4 level: there is decreased signal within the intervertebral body disc representing desiccation. there is a mild concentric posterior disc bulge which flattens the anterior thecal sac. the posterior elements are unremarkable. there is no significant central canal or foraminal stenosis. at the l4-5 level: there is a mild concentric posterior disc bulge which flattens the thecal sac. mild to moderate hypertrophic and degenerative changes involve the bilateral facet joints. there is no significant central canal or neural foraminal stenosis. the l5-s1 level: there is no disc bulge or herniation. no central canal or foraminal stenosis. there is decreased signal arising from the l5-s1 disc on t2 weighted images reprsenting disc desiccation. the signal arising from within bone marrow is normal and no fracture is seen. no spondylosis.
the vertebral body height, alignment, and marrow signal are normal. the spinal cord is normal in contour and signal intensity, without evidence of edema. there is no ligamentous edema. the central canal is normal in caliber.
examination is limited by motion artifact. cervical images demonstrate mild spondylosis at the c5-6 level indenting the thecal sac and producing mild narrowing of the left neural foramen. the cord cannot be evaluated for signal abnormalities due to motion artifact. the cerebellar tonsils are normal in position. there is no compression of cervical structures. vertebrae are of normal signal intensity and are normally aligned. thoracic images demonstrate normal vertebral alignment and signal intensity. again, the thoracic portion of the spinal cord cannot be evaluated for signal abnormalities due to motion artifact. the conus is in normal position and has a grossly normal appearance. lumbosacral images demonstrate normal vertebral alignment. the l5-s1 intervertebral disc is desiccated, and there is a mild bulge of this disc, but there is no spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis. mild facet joint degenerative changes are also present at l4-5 and l5-s1 levels. there is limited evaluation of the cauda equina. the bladder appears enlarged.
there has been interval cervical spinal surgery. the patient appears to be s/p removal of the posterior elements of c3 and c4, and occipital fusion. there is susceptibility artifact in the region of the anterior arch of c1 from air following c1-2 decompression. the degree of spinal stenosis has markedly improved s/p surgery in the upper cervical spine. there remains spinal stenosis at c5-6 and c6-7, unchanged from the pre- operative studies. there is a small area of increased signal intensity on t2 weighted images within the spinal cord at the level of c1, unchanged from the pre- operative studies. no new signal abnormalities are noted within the spinal cord, and no concerning epidural lesions are identified. there is enhancement in the surgical bed, which is to be expected.
this study is severely limited due to patient motion. there is also a significant amount of magnetic susceptibility artifact from the anterior spinal fusion spanning from c5 to c7. these images are non- diagnostic and we cannot exclude an epidural process such as an epidural abscess or enhancement in the marrow cavities. the alignment of the cervical vertebrae is within normal limits. there is a prominent amount of pannus at the atlanto-axial joint which is consistent with degenerative change.
each of the discs of the level screened, c2-c7 is narrowed and at each level there are bilateral disc/osteophyte complexes. endplate degenerative changes are noted, as seen on the plain film from 2 days previously. there is mild relative stenosis of the left ___ foramen. there is moderate c3-4 foraminal stenosis. at c4-5, there is some indentation of the thecal sac but no clear flattening of the spinal cord. there is mild to moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis minimally worse on the left than the right. at c5-6, there is fairly severe left foraminal stenosis, as seen on the plain film. there is mild right foraminal stenosis. at c6-7, there is also severe left foraminal stenosis from the disc/osteophyte complex. mild right foraminal stenosis is seen. the c7-t1 foramina are well maintained. there is minimal anterolisthesis of c7 on t1. the spinal cord is of normal size and signal intensity and there is no spinal cord compression. the craniovertebral junction is normal.
the vertebrae are normal in height and alignment. there is no cord compression or spinal canal stenosis. there is no neural foraminal stenosis. post magnevist images are limited by patient movement during the examination. there are no areas of abnormal enhancement to suggest leukemic infiltrate in the arachnoid space. there are no changes when compared to the prior study.
from t10-11 to t12-l1 disc degenerative changes are seen. at l1-2 posterior ridging and disc bulging is seen with mild to moderate spinal stenosis. at l2-3 disc and facet degenerative changes are seen without spinal stenosis. at l3-4 and l4-5 disc and facet degenerative changes are noted with severe spinal stenosis at both these levels. at l5-s1 level there are end plate degenerative changes seen. disc bulging is noted. a small central disc protrusion is seen. there is increased signal on the adjacent end plates which appears to be secondary to degenerative change. no abnormal enhancement is seen within the disc following gadolinium. although the examination is limited for evaluation of subtle changes, no evidence of an epidural phlegmon is visualized nor is there evidence of a fluid collection. the distal spinal cord shows normal signal intensities.
evaluation of the thoracic spine is limited as no t2 weighted images nor axial images are available. there is diffusely decreased signal intensity at the thoracic vertebrae, consistent with an infiltrative process and quite possibly metastatic disease. there is no definite thoracic cord compression.
vertebral body height and alignment are normal. spinal cord signal is normal. there are no epidural or intrathecal masses. contrast- enhanced images are limited by motion artifact. no gross abnormalities are identified.
comparison was made with the previous mri examination of ___, ___. again noted are deformity and signal changes of l1 vertebral body secondary to metastatic lesion. schmorl's nodes are seen on the superior and inferior endplates of l1, unchanged. the l2 vertebra demonstrates decreased t1 and slightly increased t2 signal with subtle enhancement. there is mild deformity of the vertebral body with schmorl's nodes on both superior and inferior endplates. the deformity of the vertebral body with slight compression and the signal changes have increased since the previous study, indicating progression of the disease. however, there is no evidence of epidural mass lesion identified. no evidence of retropulsion is seen. mild disc degenerative changes are noted from l2-3 to l5-s1 level without spinal stenosis or foraminal narrowing.
there is no definite evidence of abnormal signal to suggest the presence of ligamentous injury. there is no definite abnormal marrow signal to suggest the presence of fracture or bone bruise. examination is somewhat limited by patient motion, in particular, the axial images are quite limited. there does appear to be fairly extensive degenerative disease as demonstrated on the patient's ct scan, with disc narrowing especially at c5-6, c6-7 and c7- t1. there probably is moderately high-grade canal stenosis at multiple levels starting at c3-4 and extending to c6-7. the neural foramina are not well assessed.
at l1-l2 level mild disc bulging is seen with disc degenerative changes. at l2-l3 and l3-l4 no abnormalities are seen. at l4-l5 disc degenerative change and mild bulging is seen without spinal stenosis. at l5-s1 level no abnormalities are seen. the visualized vertebral bodies and sacrum demonstrate normal intrinsic signal without compression fracture or marrow edema. the distal spinal cord show normal signal intensities. paraspinal soft tissues are unremarkable.
there is no evidence of abnormal vertebral body or ligamentous signal seen from the skull base to the t4 level. multilevel degenerative changes are identified. at c3-4 a small central disc protrusion is seen. at c4-5, c5-6, and c6-7 disc and uncovertebral degenerative changes are noted with mild bulging and mild narrowing of neural foramina bilaterally. at c7-t1 and inferiorly to t4-5 disc degenerative changes are noted. the spinal cord demonstrates normal intrinsic signal. mild indentation on the anterior aspect of the spinal cord is seen at c3-4 level by the small central disc protrusion.
there is no evidence of abnormal cord morphology or signal. there is mild disc bulging at l2-3. there is no evidence of focal disc protrusion. there is a hemangioma within the body of l4. there is no evidence of disc infection. there is no evidence of paravertebral or epidural mass. there is no evidence of canal or foraminal stenosis.
as shown on the study of ___, there is diffuse metastastic involvement of the l3 vertebral body with a fairly severe compression fracture. the degree of compression has worsened since the prior study. there is more retropulsion of fragments. the anterior/posterior dimension of the thecal sac is reduced by approximately 50% but there does not appear to be high-grade compression of the cauda equina. there is mild impingement upon the l3-4 foramina. there is a second, small area of t1 hypointensity in the anterior right aspect of s1. it enhances less than the tumor at the l3 level and might be unrelated. in retrospect is was present previously. there is extensive retroperitoneal tumor, anterior to the vertebral bodies, most consistent with periaortic adenopathy. it extends inferiorly along the left iliac vessels, as well. on the sagittal images, the presaturation band covers it partially and comparison with the prior study is difficult. no abnormal enhancement of the cauda equina is seen.
there is no sign of disk or facet joint degenerative pathologic process, spinal stenosis or spondylolisthesis. the visualized distal spinal cord, conus medullaris and cauda equina are normal. there is a somewhat generalized reduced t1 signal of the vertebra as well as the iliac bones. as another requisition (for a head ct scan) raised the issue of hiv disease, the low t1 signal in bone marrow is known to be associated with this disorder.
there is slight retrolisthesis of c5 on c6. the remaining cervical vertbral bodies have normal alignment. there is no focal signal abnormality within the marrow of the cervical vertebral bodies. there are no areas of abnormal enhancement within or along the spinal cord. there is a hemangioma in the t4 vertebral body. on the axial images at c5-6 there is a right paracentral disc-osteophyte complex, which indents the thecal sac. there is no spinal canal or significant neural foraminal narrowing associated with this. at the remaining axial levels there are no significant degenerative changes.
there is a compression fracture of t9 vertebra, as seen on the previous ct scan. there is mild increased signal in this vertebra on the inversion recovery images, suggesting that the fracture is subacute. there are no masses in the spinal canal or paraspinal tissues associated with a fracture. there is faint prevertebral edema associated with the fracture. other visualized vertebral bodies are normal in height and alignment. there is increased t1 and t2 signal in the inferior endplate of t10 and 11 vertebrae, consistent with degenerative changes. there is artifact distorting the cervical spinal cord on the sagittal t2 weighted images. however, sagittal t2 weighted images demonstrate the cervical and thoracic spinal cord to be normal in contour and signal intensity, without evidence of edema. there is no spinal stenosis.
there is no evidence of cord compression or abnormal signal. there is no evidence of discitis or epidural abscess. there is prevertebral fluid accumulation in the upper cervical region. there is no definite evidence of focal disc protrusion or canal stenosis. alignment is maintained. there is no definite evidence of marrow injury.
there is extensive soft tissue changes posterior to the cervical spine likely represent soft tissue injury. previously visualized c7 left pedicular fracture is not well visualized. however it should be noted that ct scan is much more sensitive in detection of pedicular abnormality. the normal alignment and signal intensity of the vertebral bodies throughout the cervical spine is maintained. there is no evicence of ligamentous injury including anterior and posterior longitudinal ligament and intraspinous ligament. soft tissue changes and fluid signal within the nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal region is likely due to patient's intubated state.
the alignment of the spine is within normal limits. the vertebral body heights are well preserved, and no bone marrow abnormalities are identified. there is no evidence for spinal canal narrowing or abnormal signal within the cord. there is mild disc space narrowing at the t11-12 level. also noted is a small annular tear at the l4-5 level, without significant spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis.
the vertebral body height and alignment is normal. bone marrow signal appears mottled, likely secondary to osteopenia. the conus appears normal in contour and signal intensity, terminating at l1. at l4-5, there are mild bilateral facet joint degenerative changes without any associated spinal stenosis or neural foramen narrowing. the prostate gland appears enlarged. correlation with digital rectal examination is recommended, if not already a known abnormality. adjacent to the aorta and the inferior vena cava, there is a tubular structure that bifurcates at the level of the aortic and caval bifurcations. does the patient have an aortoiliac graft?
from c2-3 through c3-4 no spinal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing is seen. at c4-5 there is a shallow posterior osteophyte. there is moderate left and mild right sided neural foraminal narrowing. at c5-6 there is degenerative disc osteophyte complex causing indentation of the ventral portion of the thecal sac and mild narrowing of the spinal canal with moderate bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. there is also ligamentum flavum thickening, mild in degree. at c6-7 there is a small posterior disc- osteophyte complex causing moderate narrowing of the right neural foramen.
there is no change in the innumerable bony lesions which are low signal in both the t1 and t2 weighted images consistent with extensive metastatic disease. this involves the entire thoracic spine. there is no evidence of central canal compromise or cord compression. there is no change in the prior study.
in the interval since the previous examination, there has been further collapse of the l3 vertebral body. there is retropulsion of the fracture fragments along the inferior endplate margin at this time. this results in mild-to-moderate spinal canal narrowing. there is also severe left neural foraminal narrowing at l3-4 due to a combination of the bony and disc abnormalities at this level. there is moderate right neural foraminal narrowing at l3-4, as well. on the inversion recovery sequence, there is increased t2 signal within the l3 vertebral body, suggesting that there may still be some edema in this bone relating to the fracture. overall, lumbosacral spinal alignment is maintained. the remaining lumbar vertebrae are normal in signal intensity and height. there are no focal disc herniations and there is no spinal canal stenosis at the remaining lumbar vertebral levels. there are few arachnoid diverticula or perineural cysts, as seen on the previous study. the kidneys appear small and there may be a left renal cyst.
there is no evidence of focal disk protrusion. there is no evidence of canal or foraminal stenosis. cord signal and morphology are not remarkable. there is no evidence of abnormal signal on a sagittal stir sequence to suggest the presence of edema, which might reflect a ligamentous injury. there is mild reversal of the cervical lordosis, which may be positional or related to paraspinous spasm. it is noted that this does reverse somewhat with the patient in the extended position on plain films obtained ___.
there is discontinuity of the anterior longitudinal ligament at c3 level which may represent a tear. the anterior longitudinal ligament at the level of c4 vertebral body is lifted anteriorly by the underlying hemorrhage due to the fracture. the ligament appears continuous at this level, but this does not exclude damage to the all. there is a fluid collection along the anterior margin of c2 through c4 levels most consistent with hemorrhage within the paravertebral soft tissue. there is diffuse increased signal within the spinal cord extending from c3- c4 through c4-c5 level, consistent with edema. on the sagittal images, there are discontinuities within the ligamentum flavum posteriorly at c3-c4, c4- c5, and c5-c6 levels. on sagittal stir- weighted images, however, edema is seen only at c4-c5 level. at c3-c4 level, there is disc protrusion asymmetric at the left resulting in mild narrowing of the spinal canal. at c4-c5 level, there is disc protrusion, more so on the left, causing deformity of anterior aspect of the spinal cord and narrowing of bilateral neural foramina. at c5-c6, there is diffuse disc protrusion extending into the left neural foramina causing moderate spinal canal stenosis and narrowing of the left neural foramina. at c6-c7, there is mild encroachment of the spinal canal with disc osteophyte complex extending into the left neural foramina and resulting in its narrowing.
the imaged quality is somewhat poor possibly secondary to the patient's body habitus. no disc vertebral or paraspinal pathology is seen. the patient's known c2 fracture is not well visualized on this examination. there is no spinal stenosis or subluxation of the component vertebra. the visualized cord, foramen magnum and its contents are unremarkable.
the examination is limited due to motion artifact. no evidence of high-grade spinal stenosis is seen. on gradient echo and t1 axial images, no evidence of extrinsic spinal cord compression is appreciated. on sagittal t2 and inversion recovery images, artifacts have limited evaluation of the spinal canal and spinal cord. there is no evidence of vertebral malalignment seen. no evidence of ligamentous destruction is noted.
at c5-c6 level, there is a mass in the anterior portion of the spinal canal with displacement and high-grade compression of the spinal cord. the mass is isointense to the spinal cord, both on t1 and t2 weighted images, and demonstrate homogeneous enhancement. there is also enhancement of the adjacent dura seen. the mass appears to be intradural extramedullary. there is subtle increased signal seen within the spinal cord at this level indicating of cord edema. from c2-c3 to c4-c5 and from c6-c7 to t3-t4 level, mild disc degenerative changes are seen without significant disc bulge or herniation.
it is an incomplete study due to the absence of axial images and extensive motion on the stir sequence. compared to the prior study, there is increased t1 signal heterogeneity in the vertebral body consistent with worsening leukemic infiltration. there is no evidence of cord compression. a disk bulge is seen at the l1-l2 level unchanged from the prior study. the degenerative changes are stable. the vertebral body heights are preserved.
the bone marrow signal intensity is normal. the c2-c3 level is unremarkable. at c3-c4, there is mild anterolisthesis of c3 on c4. there is no significant stenosis of the canal or foramina. at c4-c5, there is also anterolisthesis of c4 on c5. there are bilateral disk/osteophytes complexes, and there is apparent slight flattening of the spinal cord. the left foramen appears to be moderately stenotic. at c5-c6, there is moderate-sized right-sided disk/osteophyte complex with fairly severe right foraminal stenosis. the foramen is well maintained, and there is no flattening of the spinal cord. there is a broad-based disk/osteophyte complex at c6-c7 with minimal anterolisthesis of c6 on c7. there is moderate left foraminal stenosis. the c7-t1 level is normal. sagittal images show a small right-sided disk protrusion at t1-t2 with associated osteophytes. the spinal cord is of normal size and signal intensity, and the craniovertebral junction is normal.
there is a region of vasogenic edema in the posterior fossa and there is an irregular ring-enhancing mass in the posterior fossa consistent with the patient's known brain metastases. there is no abnormal signal in or enhancement of the cervical spinal cord. the marrow signal and alignment of the cervical vertebrae is unremarkable. the study is limited due to a prominent amount of motion artifact.
in the upper cervical spine on the axial images, no evidence of spinal cord compression or intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities are seen. no abnormal enhancement is noted.
the study is somewhat limited due to patient motion. there is a possible slight disc bulge at the c4-5 level without evidence of neural canal or neural foraminal narrowing. there is no disc, vertebral or paraspinal pathology seen. there is no spinal stenosis or subluxation of the component vertebrae. the visualized spinal cord, foramen magnum and its contents are unremarkable.
this study is somewhat limited by the image quality. disc bulge at c2-3 does not cause significant spinal stenosis. moderate spinal stenosis is noted at the c3-4, ___, and ___ levels secondary to posterior concentric disc bulging and corresponding posterior osteophytes seen on ct scan. posterior disc protrusion is also noted at t1 to 2 but does not cause significant compression. the remainder of the thoracic spine is unremarkable. the above findings were discussed with dr. ___ on ___ at noon.

there is mild disc protrusion at c4-5, c5-6, and c6-7 with mild canal stenosis at c5-6. there is mild left neural foraminal narrowing at c5-6 secondary to uncovertebral spurring. no definite metastatic lesions are identified in the cervical spine.
sagittal images demonstrate normal anteroposterior alignment of the lumbar vertebrae. there is degenerative changes at all of the interspaces, including endplate osteophyte formation, signal changes, disc desiccation, and disc bulges. there are also schmorl's nodes at t12-l1, l1-2, and l2-3 interspaces. a focus of increased t1 and t2 signal in the l1 vertebral body is probably a hemangioma. axial images demonstrate a bulge at the l1-2 disc, but no canal or neural foraminal narrowing is present at this level. at l2-3 there is a diffuse disc bulge without spinal stenosis or clear neural foraminal narrowing. there is a mild rotary scoliosis appreciated. at l3-4 there is a bulging disc and there is facet degenerative enlargement and ligamentous thickening. there is mild spinal stenosis, but no foraminal narrowing. at l4-5 there is a bulging disc with a right paracentral protrusion. there is also marked facet and ligamentous degenerative change. all of these findings result in severe spinal canal stenosis. there is narrowing of the l5 lateral recesses as well. the right neural foramen is moderately narrowed and the left neural formen mildly narrowed at this level. at l5-s1 there is marked facet enlargement. there is a bulging disc. the spinal canal is not stenotic. there is mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. the conus is in normal position, though it is not clearly seen due to motion artifact.

in the interval, there have been laminectomies from c3 through c6. again noted are areas of hyperintensity material on the inversion-recovery imaging sequence within the spinal canal along the posterior aspect of the vertebral bodies and anterior to the spine in the prevertebral space. these represent the unchanged appearance of an epidural abscess. hyperintensity of the intervertebral disks from c3 through c6 are unchanged and so is the increased stir signal in the upper cervical vertebrae representing discitis and osteomyelitis. these abnormal areas also demonstrate contrast enhancement. the soft tissue abnormalities in the spinal canal extend from approximately from c3 through c6. anteriorly, the abnormalities begin at the c5/6 level and extend up to the c1/2 level.
vertebral bodies are well aligned. vertebral body height and disc spaces are preserved. no bone edema is visualized. bone marrow signal is normal. mild degenerative changes are seen throughout the cervical spine. there is no evidence of prevertebral soft tissue swelling. no posterior cervical soft tissues edema is identified. craniocervical junction is normal. spinal cord has normal contours and signal intensity. c3-c4: mild bilateral neuroforaminal stenosis is visualized. no central canal stenosis is seen. c4-c5: mild right-sided neuroforaminal stenosis. no significant central canal stenosis is seen. c5-c6: moderate bilateral neuroforaminal stenosis noted. small disc osteophyte complex is present. c6-c7: small disc osteophyte complex is identified causing moderate bilateral neuroforaminal stenosis. remaining levels are within normal limits.

as noted on the previous exam, there is marked pannus formation at the c1 articulation, which results in compression of the cervicomedullary junction. axial images were not obtained through this area on the current exam. there is marked motion artifact on the axial images. spondylosis is also identified at the c3-4, c4-5, c5-6, and c6-7 levels. at c3-4, c4-5 and c5-6, there appears to be at least moderate spinal canal narrowing. the upper-thoracic canal is normal in caliber.
from the skull base to the t8-9 level, no evidence of intraspinal masses or spinal cord compression is seen. no evidence of intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities are noted. there is mild diffuse low signal visualized within the vertebral bodies, indicative of marrow hypoplasia or infiltration from patient's clinical history of multiple myeloma.
the vertebral bodies are normal in alignment and without compression deformity. the spinal cord is normal in caliber and signal intensity. t2 axial images through the mid- thoracic spine demonstrate a wide central canal without any central canal stenosis, neural foraminal stenosis, or neural impingement.
there is no evidence of abnormal signal on the stir sequence to suggest the presence of ligamentous injury. a cervical cord is normal in dimension and signal. there is no evidence of abnormal contrast enhancement. there is some degenerative disease present. this is not ideally assessed and there is some motion on the gradient echo sequence. there does appear to be bilateral neuroforaminal stenosis at c3-c4. there is a disk osteophyte bar at c4-c5 with bilateral femoral stenosis and mild canal stenosis. at c5-c6 there is left-sided neuroforaminal stenosis. at c6-c7 there is bilateral foraminal stenosis.
there is irregularity of the end plates at t12-l1 with a small amount of fluid signal intensity in the disc, and enhancement of the disc space and adjacent end plates consistent with discitis and osteomyelitis. the amount of fluid in the disc is slightly less than on ___. the marrow abnormalities are approximately stable in extent. no epidural or paraspinal inflammatory changes are seen. there is no evidence of an epidural abscess. no new abnormalities seen in the lumbar spine. please note that the t8-9 level was not evaluated on this lumbar spine study.

there has been interval resection of the previously described intradural extramedullary lesion at the c5-c6 level. the patient is status post c4 through c6 posterior laminectomy. on the current study, central increased signal intensity is identified within the spinal cord at the site of prior resection at the c5-c6 level. this was appreciated on the prior exam, but due to severe compression on that examination, it is difficult to appreciate whether this amount of edema has increased. post-surgical changes are noted in the area of prior laminectomy. no cord compression is appreciated on the current exam. there is a small amount of linear enhancement seen along the anterior margin of the spinal cord at the resection site, which may indicate post- surgical change but residual tumor cannot be excluded at this site. vertebral body alignment and signal intensity is normal. no prevertebral soft tissue abnormality is seen.
there is considerable motion on all the images. there is no definite evidence of high-grade cord compression or abnormal alignment. there is no definite evidence of high-grade canal or foraminal stenosis.
there is no cord compression or abnormal cord signal. at t11 and t12, there is abnormal signal in the 11th and 12th vertebral bodies. there is abnormal signal in the adjacent paraspinous muscles with peripheral enhancement. this encroaches the thecal sac. furthermore there is increased enhancement of the thecal sac at t11-t12 with thickening with decreased signal intensity in the adjacent spinal canal. these findings are worrisome for an epidural abscess. the superior extension of the adjacent paraspinous abscess is not well defined, i.e., it is not clear whether it reaches the left pleural space. this collection extends inferiorly to the level of s1, best seen on series 2a image 17.
there is normal alignment of the vertebral bodies of the cervical spine. bone signal is normal. there is no edema at the c1-2 articulation. there continues to be some prevertebral edema in the upper cervical soft tissues, best seen on stir images. there are some areas of high stir signal in the posterior soft tissues, but this finding may be due to artifact and unsuppressed fat. no dedicated fat- suppression sequence was performed. visualized portion of the spinal cord is normal in contour and signal intensity. there is no evidence of focal disc hernation either on the sagittal or corresponding axial images. the spinal canal and neural foramina are wide at all levels.
there is no evidence of abnormal cord signal morphology. there is no evidence of abnormal contrast enhancement. there is a very small central disc protrusion at c5-c6 not displacing the cord nor producing canal or foraminal stenosis. there is likewise a small central disc protrusion at c6-7 again not producing canal or foraminal stenosis.
the vertebral bodies demonstrate normal height, signal intensity, and alignment. there is normal signal seen throughout the cervical cord. overall, spinal canal is patent and cord contour is within normal limits. the cervical medullary junction is patent. no significant abnormalities are seen at c2-3 or c3-4 levels. c4-5 level reveals minor facet hypertrophy. at c5-6 there is annular bulge and mild uncinate hypertrophy resulting in minimal stenosis of the exit neural foramina. similar changes at c6-7 level. c7-t1 level is unremarkable. there is no abnormal enhancement seen within the spinal cord or the canal following gadolinium administration. no extrinsic cord compression is seen.

comparison with the prior study of ___ redemonstrates the heterogeneously elevated t2 signal within the t11 and t12 vertebral bodies. this abnormal signal pattern does not appear to have progressed substantially compared to the prior examination. similarly, there has been no interval change in the t11-12 disc signal or integrity of its end plates to suggest a progressive osteomyelitis and discitis at this locale. there has been interval performance of a laminectomy at these two vertebral levels. the presumed granulation tissue spanning the laminectomy defect appears to cause mild indentation on the dorsal aspect of the thecal sac. the paraspinal abscess seen previously has regressed considerably since the drainage procedure. however, there is extensive enhancing epidural tissue, presumably a phlegmon, dorsal to the cervical cord, as well as upper thoracic cord, as far distally as approximately t3/4. there is also mild spinal cord compression in the cervical region by the epidural lesion and elevated t2 signal ion the cervical cord. these findings, in retrospect, were probably visible on the prior study, though it was degraded by patient motion.
again, signal abnormalities are seen from c3 to c7 vertebral bodies indicative of discitis and osteomyelitis. mild focal kyphosis of the mid cervical region is again noted. there are laminectomies from c3 to c7. soft tissue changes are seen near the laminectomy defect. following gadolinium, subtle enhancement is seen within the disc spaces and prevertebral soft tissues and also at the laminectomy site. however, there is no evidence of focal fluid collection identified nor there is evidence of abnormal epidural enhancement seen. there has been no significant interval change since the previous study except for decrease in the prevertebral signal abnormalities. no new areas of spinal cord compression or intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities are seen.
please review the report from the ct of the thoracic spine for detailed report on the t9 to t12 vertebral body abnormalities. the vertebral bodies of the lumbar spine have normal signal with mild dessication of the discs of l4-l5 and l5-s1. there is no evidence of spinal canal narrowing at the lumbar spine. the neural foramens are patent.
interpretation is limited due to motion artifact.
the c2-c3 level is unremarkable. at c3-c4, the disc is narrowed and there are disc space osteophytes, particularly on the right. there is moderate right foraminal stenosis and mild left foraminal stenosis. centrally, there is minimal indentation of the spinal cord. the c4-c5 disc is also narrowed and there is a central disc/osteophyte complex that indents the spinal cord. there is minimal relative stenosis of the left foramen. the c5-c6 disc is narrowed and there is a broad-based disc space osteophytes, larger on the left than the right. there is some flattening of the spinal cord on the left. there is mild left foraminal stenosis. c6 and c7 are shorter than the other vertebral bodies, likely chronic, related to spondylosis. the c6-c7 disc is narrowed and there are endplate degenerative changes with disc bulge and severe left foraminal stenosis. the c7-t1 level is normal. upper thoracic scoliosis is noted. there is ankylosis of several vertebral bodies anteriorly, with large anterior flowing osteophytes, suggesting dish. the spinal cord is of normal size and signal intensity, and the craniovertebral junction is normal.

the vertebral bodies are well maintained and normally aligned. no bone marrow or ligamentous edema is seen to suggest a fracture or ligamentous injury in the cervical spine. there is no edema near the left c5-c6 facet joint to suggest a recent fracture in that region. comparison is made to the ct of ___. there is some superficial edema overlying the spinous processes of t1 through t4, the inferior aspect of the field of view. on the far lateral sagittal images, some edema is seen in the region of the transverse process fractures demonstrated on the ct. the subarachnoid space is well maintained and the spinal cord is of normal size and signal intensity. the craniovertebral junction is normal. there is soft tissue thickening in the sphenoid sinus.
vertebral bodies are normal in height and alignment. there is a round focus of increased t1 and t2-weighted signal within the body of c2, which represents a hemangioma. no prevertebral soft tissue swelling is seen. there is normal alignment of the cervical vertebrae. there is decreased t2 signal within the majority of the cervical disks, consistent with desiccation. the c6/7 disk appears flattened. there is a mild-moderate focal posterior herniation of the c5/6 intervertebral disk with caudal extrusion of disk fragments, which is just to the left of midline, which indents the ventral cord surface but does not cause signal abnormality within the cord. spinal canal diameter is capacious, with good csf signal around the cord at all levels within the cervical spine. there is minimally increased signal on gradient echo sequences within the posterior paraspinal muscles, which likely represents edema. this is nonspecific in etiology. there is no overt evidence of ligamentous injury on the stir sequence, but ligamentous injury cannot be completely excluded via mri.
sagittal images of the lumbosacral spine demonstrate normal spinal alignment. vertebral body height and signal are maintained. there is bulging of the l4-5 intervertebral disc and there is degenerative change in the facet joint complexes at this level, including the presence of a subchondral cyst on the right. this produces mild spinal canal stenosis. due to facet osteophyte formation and the bulging disc, the neural foramina are somewhat narrowed, greater on the left than the right. at the remaining lumbar levels, the discs have a normal appearance and there is no canal stenosis or foraminal encroachment. images are somewhat blurred, but there is the sense of increased soft tissue signal within the thecal sac at the level of l3. this could represent clumped nerve roots. a followup study is recommended, with gadolinium enhancement, to clarify these findings.
this study is limited by motion. the axial images are severely limited by motion. again noted are mild-to-moderate degenerative changes in the cervical spine at c3-c4, c4-c5, and c5-c6 and c6-c7, and appears to be not significantly changed since the prior examination. however, the axial images are limited by motion, which limits the evaluation.
conus terminates in the normal position. there is no abnormal signal within the distal portion of the spinal cord or the vertebral bodies. there is high t1 and high t2 lesion within the t12 vertebral body superior end plate which most likely represents a hemangioma. there is a large schmorl's node involving the inferior end plate of l3 vertebral body. posterior to l3 vertebral body and extending to the l4-l5 intervertebral disc, there is an epidural collection anteriorly which is slightly bright on t1- weighted images and of intermediate signal on t2 weighted images. this has led to compression of the thecal sac and its nerve roots. its configuration is most consistent with an epidural hematoma. at l4-l5 level, there is disc degenerative disease with moderate diffuse disc bulge resulting in moderate narrowing of the spinal canal in association with facet degenerative changes and ligamentous thickening posteriorly. at l5-s1 level, there is a tiny disc herniation which appears to extend posterior to s1 nerve roots and causes mild deformity of anterior portion of the thecal sac but no significant spinal stenosis is seen. there are bilateral facet degenerative changes, left greater than right which appears to have led to severe left neural foraminal narrowing.
there is a remote compression fracture of l1 with approximately 50% of reduction of vertebral height. there is no abnormal signal on t1 or t2 indicating that this is not an acute fracture. no bony fragments are compressing the spinal canal or the exiting nerve roots. the visualized distal spinal cord, conus medullaris, and cauda equina are unremarkable. incidental note is made of cystic changes in the left kidney that should be further evaluated with additional imaging studies.
the vertebrae are normal in height and alignment. prevertebral soft tissue swelling is noted in the upper cervical spine consistent with secondary signs of fracture of cervical vertebrae as noted on the previous cat scan. edema is also noted in the soft tissues along the posterior elements in the upper cervical spine consistent with ligamentous injury. disc protrusion is noted at the level of c5-6 with facet and uncinate hypertrophy thereby causing severe spinal stenosis at this level. this could be degenerative in nature associated with some traumatic component.
the cervical cord is normal in dimension and signal. some abnormal signal in the posterior paraspinal muscle areas are identified consistent with the findings identified on the patient's ct scan and the previous evacuation of the right cerebellar hematoma. there is a small amount of abnormal signal in the subarachnoid space at the level of the foramen magnum posterior to the cervical cord not causing cord compression consistent with a high density area seen on the patient's ct scan of ___ probably representing some blood products associated with either the cerebellar hemorrhage or subsequent surgery. there is no evidence of abnormal signal within the vertebral bodies. alignment is maintained.
there is reversal of the normal cervical lordosis. there is grade 1 anterolisthesis of c3 on c4. the visualized contents of the posterior fossa are unremarkable. pneumatization of the clivus is incidentally noted. at the atlantoaxial articulation, there is a small amount of thickened soft tissue that could represent pannus. the tip of the dens is irregular and may be offset, and several linear low signal defects are present. although there is no significant corresponding stir hyperintensity to indicate acute injury, this appearance is concerning for a fracture. severe multilevel degenerative changes are present. facet arthropathy is present at essentially all the visualized cervical levels. c2-c3: a mild right paracentral disc-spur complex results in narrowing of the right neural foramen. there is no central canal stenosis. c3-c4: broad-based disc-spur complex results in moderate to severe central canal stenosis and narrowing of the bilateral neural foramen. c4-c5 and c5-c6: broad-based disc-spur complex results in severe central canal stenosis as well as some narrowing of the bilateral neural foramen. c6-c7: broad-based disc-spur complex results in moderate to severe central canal stenosis and moderate narrowing of the bilateral neural foramen. the central canal stenosis is associated with mildly increased t2 signal in the central cord, compatible with edema. findings were discussed with dr. ___ ___ at 1720 hours on the day of the study.
there is grade 1/grade 2 anterolisthesis of l5 on s1, and bilateral l5 pars defects are present. the globular signal void at the l5/s1 interspace centrally is compatible with vacuum disk phenomenon. at this level, there is a diffuse disk bulge as well as a small right paracentral disk extrusion projecting superiorly. the bilateral neural foramina are stenotic. there is a prominent ovoid structure projecting towards the right l5/s1 neural foramen. it is isointense to the disk on all sequences. its association with the right-sided facets and pars defect suggest that it may represent a fibrosis or a synovial process such as a cyst with debris. other than mild multilevel facet arthropathy, the remainder of the visualized disk spaces are unremarkable. there is no marrow edema or evidence of acute fracture. findings were discussed with dr. ___ ___ on the day of the study at 1720 hours.
there are no vertebral body or paraspinal abnormalities noted. there is no evidence of spinal stenosis or abnormal signal within the spinal cord. under the best of circumstances, mr has low sensitivity for detecting spinal avm's. absent contrast, the sensitivity is even lower. however, with these limitations, there is no evidence for an arteriovenous malformation. there is a small disc protrusion at c7-t1. due to motion artifact on this study, assessment of the ligaments is limited, but there are no gross abnormalities.
this study is limited by extensive patient motion, which limits anatomic detail. no abnormal signal is seen within the cervical spinal cord with no abnormal epidural collection seen. the cervical spine vertebral bodies are normal in signal and height. multilevel degenerative change is present with loss of intervertebral disk space height and spondylosis. at the level of c3-c4, mild spinal canal stenosis is present secondary to a disc osteophyte complex without narrowing of the neuroforamina. at the level of c4-c5, there is loss of intervertebral disk space height, minimal anterolisthesis of c4 on c5. no neuroforaminal or spinal canal stenosis is seen at this level. at the level of c5-c6, mild spinal canal stenosis is seen secondary to a disc protrusion with no neuroforaminal narrowing. at the level of c6-c7, there is minimal retrolisthesis of c6 on c7 with left neuroforaminal narrowing secondary to facet joints and uncovertebral joint degenerative change. no spinal canal stenosis seen. at the level of c7-t1, there is minimal anterolisthesis of c7 on t1 with some mild bilateral neuroforaminal narrowing and no spinal canal strenosis.
there is normal alignment and height of the vertebral bodies. the intervertebral disc spaces are maintained. there is no compression of the distal spinal cord/cauda equina. the signal in the visualized distal spinal cord, conus medullaris, and cauda equina are unremarkable.
the l1 vertebral body is normal in appearance. within the l2 vertebral body, there is increased stir and decreased t1 signal suspicious for metastatic disease versus a schmorl's node. within the l3 vertebral body, there is a similar appearance suspicious for metastatic disease versus a schmorl's node. also, within the l3 vertebral body, there is a possible compression fracture. within the superior aspect of the l4 vertebral body, there is a schmorl's node versus a metastatic focus. again, in the l5 vertebral body, there is a region concerning for metastatic focus. there are probable schmorl's nodes within the t10 and t11 vertebral bodies. there is abnormal signal within the t12 vertebral body, suspicious for fracture. there is no evidence of spinal canal stenosis, disk protrusion or neuroforaminal stenosis. the l3 vertebral body lesion appears to extend into the pedicle. the rectum appears distended.
there is moderate to high-grade lumbar canal stenosis at l4-5 attributable to mild anterolisthesis with posterior element overgrowth. there is no evidence of epidural hematoma as low as t12. there is abnormal signal in the right iliacus muscle consistent with hematoma formation.
again, signal abnormalities are seen involving the left lateral mass of c2 with adjacent changes in the left lateral mass of c1. mild enhancement is seen and soft tissue changes are noted in this region. overall, no significant interval change is noted. mild enhancement of the soft tissues is also seen in this region. from c2-3 to c6-7, disc degenerative changes are noted. mild disc bulging is seen from c3-4 to c6-7 with mild spinal stenosis at c3-4 and moderate spinal stenosis at c4-5 and c5-6 levels as before. there is mild extrinsic indentation on the spinal cord seen at c4-5 level. following gadolinium, no abnormal intraspinal enhancement is seen. the spinal cord demonstrates normal intrinsic signal without abnormal enhancement. a chronic pontine infarct is again visualized.
since the previous study, the patient has undergone laminectomy at l3-4 level with spinal fusion. at l4-5 level, there is increased irregularity and signal changes at the endplates with enhancement within the disc, indicative of discitis and osteomyelitis. these findings have increased since the previous study. there is also mild spondylolisthesis of l4 over l5. there has been a laminectomy at this level with soft tissue changes within the laminectomy defect indenting the posterior aspect of the thecal sac. there is indentation on the posterior aspect of the thecal sac at l2-3 and l3-4 level, which has high t1 signal, which could be due to epidural fat, which has changed in appearance since the previous study, related to surgery. however, to exclude hematoma in this region if clinically indicated, consider inversion recovery sagittal and post-gadolinium fat suppressed sagittal images. disc degenerative changes and bulging is seen at l2-3 and l3-4 level. at l5-s1 level, grade 1 spondylolisthesis of l5 over s1 is seen with disc bulging. at l4-5 level, soft tissue changes and bulging disc severely narrow the right neural foramen, which could result in irritation of the exiting right l4 nerve root. there is also moderate narrowing of the left neural foramen. the distal spinal cord shows normal signal intensities.
there are multiple small lesions with low t1 and t2 signal in all of the visualized vertebral bodies of the lumbar spine, sacrum, and visualized portions of the iliac bones consistent with metastases. there is a mild compression deformity of l5 vertebra previously noted on lumbar spine radiographs of ___. other visualized vertebral bodies maintain normal height. there is grade 1 anterolisthesis at l5-s1, unchanged since ___. the conus terminates at t12, and it appears unremarkable. no epidural or intradural soft tissue masses are noted. evaluation for leptomeningeal metastases is limited by absence of intravenous contrast. at l4-5, there is a small central disc protrusion with no associated central stenosis or neural foramen narrowing. at l5-s1, there is grade 1 anterolisthesis with bilateral pars defects, as seen on ___. there is a disc bulge. there is moderate narrowing of the right and left neural foramina. no signal abnormalities identified in the visualized paraspinal soft tissues.

comparison with ___ mri of the cervical spine. there has been interval fusion of the c4 through c7 vertebral bodies, with laminectomies from c4 through c7. the posterior epidural hematoma has resolved. however, in the spinal cord at the level of c6-7, there is a 7 by 12mm region of high t2 signal, with slight cord expansion. this represents edema within the spinal cord. enhancement in this area probably reflects hyperemia from recent cord injury, rather than a neoplasm. there is still a moderate to large amount of prevertebral soft tissue swelling, reprsenting residual hematoma, as well as possible post-surgical effect, from c1-5. also, seen is extensive edema in the soft tissues of the posterior neck around the region of recent surgery. high signal in the disk spaces at c4-5, c5-6, and c6-7 probably represent post- surgical changes.
vertebral body height and alignment is normal throughout. there is edema in the c4 left inferior facet, c5 left superior and inferior facet, and adjacent paraspinal soft tissues. an acute fracture may be present. further evaluation by ct is recommended. evaluation of the spinal cord signal is limited by motion artifact and technical factors. there is no definite abnormal spinal cord signal to suggest contusion or hemorrhage. no epidural collections are identified. multilevel degenerative changes are noted. at c2/3 and c3/4, there is loss of intervertebral disc space height, without any herniation or evidence of neural impingement. at c4/5, there is a shallow central disc protrusion without evidence of neural impingement. at c5/6, there is a left paracentral disc protrusion narrowing the left neural foramen. there is no spinal cord compression. at c6/7, is a small central disc protrusion without evidence of spinal cord compression. findings and recommendations were discussed with dr. ___ ___ at 12:00 p.m. on ___.
artifacts obscure the evaluation at lumbosacral junction secondary to metallic hardware in the region of left iliac bone. mild disc degenerative signal is seen at l3-4 and l4-5 level. the vertebral alignment is normal in the lumbar region without intraspinal fluid collection hematoma or thecal sac compression. no abnormal enhancement is seen. note is made of slight distraction of the intervertebral disc at t10-11 level with increased signal within the facet joint in intraarticular region of t10-11 level indicative of fracture at this level. this is further evaluated with thoracic spine mri. there is no evidence of paraspinal hematoma or fluid collection seen in the lumbar region.
there is an abnormality extending from t1 inferiorly to the lower edge of the study, located in the posterior spinal canal with features suggesting epidural hematoma formation. there are soft tissue fluid collections with layering high-density material most likely representing soft tissue hemorrhage. this is fairly extensive and raises the question of arterial injury. the visualized right common carotid artery and right vertebral artery in the inferior neck are patent but are not visualized in the superior most portion of the neck. there is some abnormal soft tissue edema noted posteriorly and anterior to the cervical spine. this could reflect ligamentous disruption and raises the question of instability of the cervical spine. there appears to be some increased signal on the cord starting at c6- c7 and extending inferiorly. this finding, however, is not definite.
there is evidence of laminectomies from c3 through c7 with a small amount of fluid in the posterior paraspinal soft tissues, probably representing a postoperative seroma. a disk protrusion at c3/4 is stable. the spinal canal has been decompressed by the laminectomies. the abnormal high signal in the spinal cord at c3/4 on t2-weighted and stir images appears unchanged. there is distraction of the anterior c3/4 disk space, consistent with a known anterior longitudinal ligament tear and suggestive of continued spinal instability while the bone grafts are not fused. prevertebral hematoma at c3/4 is decreased in size. degenerative changes at c4/5 and c5/6 appear unchanged. review of the patient's other neurologic imaging reveals a subacute infarction in the left middle cerebral artery territory, as reported on the brain mri performed on ___. given the history of trauma, on ___, this raises suspicion for the left carotid dissection with subsequent embolism to the left middle cerebral artery. evaluation with a neck mr angiogram, including fat suppressed t1-weighted images, is suggested. this was discussed with the micu resident at 4:30 p.m. on ___.
mild disc degenerative change and bulging is seen at l3-4 and l5-s1 levels. no evidence of spinal stenosis or thecal sac compression is seen. the distal spinal cord shows normal signal intensities. mild subcutaneous edema is seen in the posterior soft tissues.
examination of the sagittal images demonstrates no evidence of spondylolisthesis. there is anterior osteophyte formation at the disc spaces of the l2-3 level associated with anterior disc bulge. in addition, there is a horizontal linear signal abnormality at the superior aspect of the l5 endplate, with elevated stir signal, and low signal on t1- weighted images, which has a slight offset of the superior portion slightly anterior to the more inferior aspects of this vertebral body level. there is elevated stir and t2-weighted signal in the subcutaneous soft tissues posterior to the l3 operative site, with laminectomy defect at the l3 level, but without discrete or drainable fluid collections in this region. at the t12-l1 level, there is no evidence of neural foraminal narrowing or central canal stenosis. no evidence of disc bulge or compression fracture. at the l1-2 level, there is no evidence of neural foraminal narrowing or central canal stenosis, and no evidence of vertebral body or intervertebral disc height loss or disc herniation. at the l2-3 level, there are concavities of the inferior endplate of l2 and the superior endplate of l3 , without evidence of disc bulge. there is a small anterior disc bulge at this level, with some associated osteophytes. no central canal or neural foraminal narrowing is evident. at the l3-4 level, there are concavities of the inferior endplate of l3 and the superior endplate of l4. there is moderately severe narrowing of both neural foraminal spaces, slightly worse on the right than on the left, which appears to be due to a combination of hypertrophic facet joint changes as well as congenital short pedicles. again, there are changes status post laminectomy at the l3 level. at the l4-5 level, there are again concavities of the inferior endplate of l4 and the superior endplate of l5. there is minimal symmetric bilateral neural foraminal narrowing, as well as mild central canal stenosis, secondary to hypertrophic facet joint changes as well as some thickening of the ligamentum flavum. there also appears to be a mild right paracentral disc bulge at this level. as described above there is compression fracture at the superior endplate of l5. at the l5-s1 level, there is mild left-sided neural foraminal narrowing and moderate right-sided neural foraminal narrowing, secondary to combination of short pedicle, hypertrophic changes of the facet joints, and thickening of the ligamentum flavum. there is a broad-based posterior disc bulge at this level with a central protrusion. mild-to-moderate central canal stenosis is also evident at this level. endplate concavities are also seen at this level. note is also made of low t1 and t2 weighted signal in the l1-2 disc space, consistent with some focal calcification of the intervertebral disc. visualized portions of the pelvic structures appear unremarkable.
study is minimally limited by motion. the vertebrae are normal in height and alignment. no signal abnormality is noted within the spinal cord. no cord compression noted. the posterior fossa of the brain is unremarkable.
vertebral body height is preserved throughout. there is grade 1 retrolisthesis at l2/3 with associated mild narrowing of the spinal canal. there is evidence of posterior fusion at l1-s1. evaluation of bone marrow signal is limited by the surgical hardware and associated artifact. there are no epidural masses. the conus terminates at 12/l1, and it appears unremarkable. there are no disc protrusions or herniations. while evaluation of the neural foramina is limited by artifact related to the surgical hardware, there is no definite neural foramen narrowing. there is a 7 mm well-defined round lesion with high t2 signal in the right kidney. it was previously seen on the abdominal mri of ___, where it was better characterized. the following preliminary report was provided by dr. ___: artifact obscuring detail within the images secondary to the patient's spine hardware. retrolisthesis at l2/3 with impingement of the spinal canal and neural foramina, left greater than right, at l1/2 and l2/3.
from the skull base to t4 level, there is no evidence of abnormal signal within the vertebral bodies or neural arches. no evidence of abnormal signal is seen in the ligamentous structures. no evidence of ligamentous disruption or vertebral malalignment is seen. mild disc bulging and a small central disc herniation are seen at c5-6 level, slightly indenting the thecal sac. no evidence of spinal stenosis or foraminal narrowing is seen. the vertebral artery flow voids are maintained. there is fluid seen within the nasopharynx, which could be secondary to intubation. the prevertebral soft tissue thickness otherwise is maintained. the spinal cord shows normal signal intensities without extrinsic compression or intrinsic focal abnormalities. soft tissue changes are seen within the sphenoid sinus.
there is again seen malalignment of c3 on c4, with a perched right facet of c3 upon c4, unchanged from the ct of the cervical spine performed on the same date. there are comminuted fractures of c3 and c4, better demonstrated on the ct of the cervical spine. there is ligamentous disruption at the level of the comminuted c3 fracture, and grade i anterior subluxation of c3 on c4. there is narrowing of the spinal canal at this level with cord compression, and abnormal t2 and stir signal within the cord, highly suspicious for cord contusion. there is additional stir hyperintensity within the paravertebral soft tissues about the fracture site, as well as within the posterior soft tissues of the neck. t1 fat saturated images obtained through the neck demonstrate hyperintensity adjacent to the right vertebral artery at the level of the fractures, which is very suspicious for a right vertebral artery dissection. in addition, there is a suggestion of hyperintensity on the fat saturated images about the left vertebral artery, a finding that is somewhat suspicious of a left vertebral artery dissection. there is no evidence of susceptibility artifact within the cord to suggest hemorrhage within the cord.
at l2-3 level, disc degenerative changes and mild bulging is noted. at l3-4, there are endplate signal abnormalities with irregularities of the endplates. following gadolinium enhancement of the intervertebral disc, it is noted with mild epidural soft tissue enhancement predominantly in the anterior aspect on the right side and on the right side of the thecal sac. there is no evidence of focal fluid collections seen. findings are indicative of discitis and osteomyelitis with epidural soft tissue phlegmon. there is no evidence of focal fluid collection seen. there is disc protrusion within the inferior portion of right neuroforamen along with soft tissue inflammatory changes. no evidence of compression of exiting nerve root is seen. at l4-5 and l5-s1 levels, disc degenerative change and mild bulging is seen without spinal stenosis. the distal spinal cord shows normal signal intensities.
the previous study's sagittal t1 weighted images of the thoracic spine were obtained post gadolinium administration, and showed patchy enhancement of the spine throughout, which was suggestive of metastatic disease. on the noncontrast sagittal t1-weighted image of the thoracic spine on the present examination, the heterogeneous signal intensity of the spine is not visualized, but appears minimally and diffusely hypointense. therefore, the heterogeneous appearance was clearly a result of the gadolinium injection- while possibly a non-neoplastic effect, given tumor eleswhere, neoplastic disease is still the most likely explanation of the finding. within the cervical spine, there is multilevel cervical spondylosis with diffuse foraminal narrowing at each level. the spondylosis at c3-4 is mildly indenting the cord. however, there is no evidence of cord edema and the central canal is still patent elsewhere, without cord compression. no spinal cord compression is seen within the thoracic spine. there is again prominence of the anterior epidural space at t10 as seen on the previous exam, raising the idea of an epidural tumor lesion. there is no compression of the cord at this level. there is a smaller, similar finding at t11.
the vertebrae are normal in height. grade 1 anterolisthesis is noted of c4/c5. there is grade 1 retrolisthesis of c5/c6. the spinal cord is unremarkable. the posterior fossa of the brain is unremarkable. at the level of c2-c3: there is no significant disc disease or central or neural canal stenosis. at the level of c3-c4: no significant disc disease or central or neural canal stenosis. at the level of c4-c5: there is facet and uncinate hypertrophy noted on the left thereby causing moderately severe left neural canal narrowing. at the level of c5-c6: mild to moderate neural canal stenosis noted on the left secondary to facet and uncinate hypertrophy. the central canal is unremarkable. at the level of c6-c7 and c7-t1: no significant disc disease or central or neural canal stenosis noted.
sagittal images demonstrate normal lumbosacral vertebral alignment. there are degenerative changes along the endplate margins at the l4-5 and l5-s1 levels. there was also disk desiccation and loss of disk space height at l2-3 through l5-s1 levels. conus is in normal position and has a normal appearance. axial images through the l3-4 interspace demonstrate a minimal disk bulge and no canal or foraminal narrowing. at l4-5, there is also a bulging disk and there is thickening of the facets and ligaments, producing mild spinal canal stenosis. the neural foramina are also mildly narrowed bilaterally. at the l5-s1 level there is a protruding disk which contacts the ventral surface of the thecal sac and the s1 nerve roots. the spinal canal is mildly narrowed due to thickened ligamentum flavum and facet osteophytes. there is also mild narrowing of the neural foramina bilaterally.
again noted is congenital fusion of the c2 and c3 vertebrae and posterior elements. the first complete intervertebral disc space therefore represents the c3/4 level. there is multilevel degenerative change within the cervical spine, with anterior and posterior osteophytosis and thickening of the ligamentum flavum. this is most prominent at c3-4, c4-5, c5-6, and c6-7. at c3-4 through c5-6, there is associated spinal stenosis with cord compression. there is a suggestion of increased signal on stir imaging within the cord at the c3 through c6 level associated with the area of cord compression. in addition, there is neural foraminal narrowing at the involved levels due to posterior osteophytosis and uncovertebral joint degenerative change. no evidence of acute fracture is identified within the cervical spine. the posterior longitudinal ligament and interspinous ligament appear unremarkable. the anterior longitudinal ligament is not visualized in its entirety, a finding that could relate to chronic degenerative process, although as the ligament is not visualized, a component of traumatic injury could not be entirely excluded. there is a small amount of prevertebral fluid anterior to c4 through t1, however, there is no swelling of the prevertebral soft tissues at these levels. there is no abnormal signal on stir within the posterior soft tissues. note is made of a compression deformity of the t3 vertebra without evidence of edema consistent with a chronic compression fracture. a bridging osteophyte at the c5-6 level is again seen, without evidence of abnormal signal on stir to suggest edema. again, this does not appear consistent with an acute fracture.
craniocervical junction is unremarkable. there is no abnormal signal within the spinal cord or the vertebral bodies. on the stir images, there is minimal increased t2 signal within the soft tissues posterior to the occipital scalp and upper cervical scalp. this could be due to recent fall, however, note, abnormal increased t2 signal within the visualized osseous structures is noted. there is mild disc degenerative disease involving the lower portion of the cervical spine, in specific, involving c5-c6 and c6-c7 with mild disc bulges at these 2 levels resulting in mild to moderate narrowing of the spinal canal at c5-c6 and mild narrowing at c6-c7 levels. on this markedly technically limited imaging, no gross abnormality of the neural foramina is seen.
at the craniocervical junction, no abnormalities are seen. at c2- c3, mild degenerative disc disease is seen. at c3-c4, c4-c5 and c5-c6, disc degenerative changes are noted with mild disc bulging without spinal stenosis. mild right foraminal narrowing is seen at c5-c6 level. at c6-c7, disc and endplate degenerative changes are identified with uncovertebral degenerative changes. there is moderate to severe narrowing of the right neural foramen and mild narrowing of the left neural foramen. at c7-t1 and inferiorly to t4-t5, degenerative disc disease is seen without spinal stenosis. the spinal cord demonstrates normal intrinsic signal without extrinsic compression.
on t2-weighted images, within the vertebral body of l2, there is increased signal intensity. additionally, there is a focal fracture line seen. these findings are consistent with a compression deformity. there is normal signal intensity in the remaining vertebral bodies. additionally, there is no abnormal signal within the posterior elements of l2, or in the adjacent epidural space. with these findings, this represents an acute compression fracture, most likely secondary to insufficiency though a pathologic fracture cannot be entirely excluded. there is also a compression deformity within the l1 vertebral body, without any abnormally increased signal on t2 images, consistent with a chronic compression deformity. there is a focus of increased t2 signal within the l1 vertebral body which represents a hemangioma. a disc bulge is noted at the l3/4 level. there is no evidence of spinal canal stenosis or cord compression. no other disc abnormalities are identified at the remaining lumbar levels. the neural foramina are not compressed at any of the lumbar levels bilaterally. the visualized distal spinal cord, conus medullaris, and cauda equina are normal.
as seen on the somewhat limited study of ___, there is edema involving the c3, c4, c5 and c6 vertebral bodies with surrounding epidural and paraspinal inflammatory changes, and enhancement of the c3/4, c4/c5 and c5/c6 disks, findings consistent with discitis and osteomyelitis. there is some fluid in the c5/c6 disk, as seen previously. the prior study showed posterior bilateral non-enhancing material contiguous with the disk, most consistent with an epidural abscess. this appears to have markedly improved compared to the prior study. there remains thick epidural enhancement at c4/c5, and c5/c6, with extension into the foramina at both levels. there is edematous enhancing soft tissue anterior to the affected vertebral bodies as well without evidence of paraspinal abscess. there have been laminectomies at each of the levels between c3 and c7 and there is kyphosis, centered at c4, unchanged. no spinal cord compression is seen.

on the sagittal t2-weighted images, the spinal cord appears slightly heterogeneous, but no definite lesion is seen on 2 sets of sagittal stir images. there is mild spondylosis with small disc space osteophytes seen at each of the levels between c2 and c6. there is no mass effect on the spinal cord. there is no evidence of an epidural abscess or discitis. in the subcutaneous fat, well posterior to the t1 spinous process, there is a 16-mm area of fluid signal intensity, likely a sebaceous cyst. note is made of partial opacification of the sphenoid sinus. the craniovertebral junction is normal.
sagittal images demonstrate normal lumbosacral spinal alignment. vertebral body height is maintained. there are few foci of increased t1 and t2 signal in the vertebrae, which are probably hemangiomata. otherwise, vertebral height and signal are maintained. the spinal canal is wide. the conus is in normal position and has a normal appearance. due to motion artifact, there is limited visibility of the cauda equina. post-gadolinium scans reveal no abnormal enhancement of the bones or discs. there is no grossly abnormal enhancement of the intraspinal or intrathecal structures, though the examination is somewhat limited.
there are no compression fractures. at each of the levels between l1 and l5, there is a mild disc bulge. based upon the sagittal images, there just not appear to be significant spinal stenosis. there is some stenosis of the left l3/l4 foramen with only minimal normal fat remaining in it. the right l4/l5 foramen also appears to be somewhat stenotic. schmorl's nodes are noted at the superior endplates of l3, l4, and l5. the conus medullaris is seen at the l1 level. the distal spinal cord appears normal.
in the cervical and thoracic region, no evidence of disc herniation or spinal stenosis is seen. the spinal cord demonstrates normal signal from skull base to conus level. no evidence of intrinsic signal, focal abnormalities or extrinsic compression seen. there is no evidence of epidural collection noted. no evidence of epidural or subdural hematoma seen. no abnormal enhancement is identified. soft tissue changes are seen in the sphenoid sinus.
the lumbar vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs appear normal. the spinal canal and neural foramina are well maintained. the conus medullaris and cauda equina appear normal.
sagittal images demonstrate a compression deformity of the l1 vertebral body. compression is of a moderate degree, but there is not retropulsion of fragments into the spinal canal. the l1 vertebral body is abnormally dark on t1 and t2- weighted images, indicative of complete marrow replacement by tumor. the l2 and l3 vertebral bodies are t1 and t2 hyperintense, suggesting effects of radiation therapy. other bones have mottled bone marrow, likely reflecting infiltrative neoplasm. the spinal canal is not narrowed. in the lumbar spinal canal, along the cauda equina, there are numerous small nodules, best seen on the t2-weighted sagittal images. these are most likely metastatic deposits from cns dissemination of tumor. the conus has a normal appearance.
from t12-l1 to l2-3, disk degenerative change and mild bulging is seen without spinal stenosis. at l3-4, there are depressions seen on the endplates at the inferior endplate of l3 and superior endplate of l4 with increased t2 and decreased t1 signal along the endplates. following gadolinium administration, there is enhancement seen in this region with enhancement along the margins of the endplates on the right side. there is also mild prominence of the paraspinal soft tissues on the right side involving the medial aspect of the right psoas muscle with enhancement. additionally, mild soft tissue changes are seen in the right neural foramen at l3-4 level, which demonstrate enhancement. these findings are indicative of diskitis and osteomyelitis with mild paraspinal soft tissue phlegmon extending to the right neural foramen. however, there is no evidence of a focal fluid collection seen to indicate abscess at this location. at l4-5 and l5-s1 levels no evidence of disk bulge or herniation seen.
again, identified extensive multilevel lumbar degenerative disc disease. lumbosacral vertebral alignment is maintained. there are no compression deformities of the vertebrae. at l1-l2, no significant abnormalities are identified. at l2-l3, there is mild disc bulging with mild narrowing of the right neural foramen. the spinal canal is not significantly narrowed. at l3-4, axial images demonstrate a broad disc bulge with facet and ligamentous thickening, which causes impingement on the right ventral lateral thecal sac and likely the right l3 nerve root is affected. there is also canal stenosis secondary to ligamentous thickening, unchanged from the prior study. at l4-5, there is also a disk bulge, ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, and disc space osteophyte information. impingement on the right lateral thecal sac and likely the right l4 nerve is affected. there is also moderate spinal canal stenosis. at l5-s1, there is no canal or foraminal stenosis, but there is facet degenerative change. the spinal cord has normal signal intensity. the visualized paranasal soft tissues appear unremarkable. no abnormal areas of tissue enhancement are identified.
sagittal t1- and t2-weighted images through the lumbosacral region reveal degenerative changes, but no signs of osseous or disc edema or enhancement. however, there is extensive epidural abscess formation in the lumbar spinal canal, which flattens the thecal sac. additional post-gadolinium t1- weighted axial and sagittal images through the thoracic and cervical regions demonstrate thick abnormal epidural enhancement throughout the thoracic spinal canal and extending cephalad to the c1-2 level. in the lower thoracic and lumbar regions, most of the abnormal epidural enhancement and epidural abscess lies dorsal to the spinal cord and thecal sac. the cord and sac are anteriorly displaced and compressed to varying extent. the dorsal collection in the lumbar and lower thoracic area appears loculated and undulating. in the upper thoracic and cervical portions of the spine, there is thick diffuse circumferential epidural enhancement. limited sequences obtained in the cervical and thoracic region do not allow for complete evaluation of the bones or discs for signs of infection. there is no vertebral collapse or clear-cut sign of an osseous abscess. axial post-gadolinium t1-weighted images through the thoracic region do not clearly demonstrate paraspinal extension of the infection. there is patchy opacification of the inferior right lung. axial images of the lower spine demonstrate edema and abnormal enhancement in the right psoas muscle extending from roughly l3 to l5, but incompletely imaged. this is consistent with paraspinal spread of infection.
numbering is based upon the cervical and thoracic spines. based upon that numbering scheme, there is partial lumbarization of s1. in the right pedicle of l1, there is an area of t2 hyperintensity that is isointense to fatty marrow on the precontrast images of ___, most consistent with a hemangioma. other, smaller hemangiomas are seen particularly in l4 and l5. the t12/l1 disc is narrowed and there is mild disc bulge. the conus medullaris appears normal. on the post-contrast images, there is linear t1 hyperintensity in the posterior midline aspect of the thecal sac, likely a small fibrolipoma of the filum terminale, poorly seen on the prior study due to patient motion. no definite nodular enhancement is seen, although the study is limited by patient motion.
study is extremely limited secondary to extensive patient motion making many of the sequences not of diagnostic quality. the nodular areas of compression of the spinal cord from the epidural abscess are less apparent on the current study, and likely reflect some degree of improvement. there is cervical spondylosis but this cannot be analyzed in detail secondary to motion artifact. no gross new signal abnormality is seen within the spinal cord. extensive areas of increased t2 signal are seen within multiple vertebral bodies as on the prior study.
the vertebrae are normal in alignment. the posterior fossa is unremarkable. at the level c3-4, there is disc herniation with moderately severe central canal stenosis. the axial images are extremely limited by motion. at the level of c4-5: the axial images are again limited by motion. there is suggestion of severe spinal stenosis. at the level of c5-6, there is disc herniation with severe spinal stenosis noted at this level. axial images are limited by motion. at the level of c6-7: there is a disc protrusion noted with moderate central canal stenosis. moderate right neural canal stenosis noted. the left neural canal is unremarkable. extensive prevertebral soft tissue swelling noted. abnormal signal is noted within the c5 vertebral body, raising a suspicion of fracture. increased signal is noted in the ligaments along the posterior elements in the mid cervical spine, suggestive of ligamentous injury.
the patient is status post l3 laminectomy. there is new mild anterolisthesis of l4 upon l5. no posterior fixation devices are identified. a hemangioma is seen within the t12 vertebral body which is unchanged since the previous study. multilevel endplate t2 signal hyperintensity is present. at t12/l1, there is no focal disc protrusion, herniation, neural foraminal narrowing, or spinal stenosis. at l1/2, there is no significant disc protrusion, herniation, neural foraminal narrowing, or spinal stenosis. from the inferior endplate of l2 through the inferior endplate of l3, there is an intermediate signal-intensity structure along the ventral surface of the thecal sac which likely represents residual herniated disc material. there is mild spinal stenosis, but no significant neural foraminal narrowing. at l3/4, there is no significant spinal stenosis. moderate degenerative changes are present within the facets. at l4/5, there is an additional moderately large amount of residual intervertebral disc fragment which indents the ventral thecal sac. this in combination with mild anterolisthesis, moderate degenerative changes within the facets, and ligamentous thickening, causes moderate spinal stenosis. there is narrowing of the right neural foramen on pre-contrast images, but enhancement is seen within this area on post-contrast imaging, and is likely accounted for by post-surgical scar tissue. there is possible compression of the right l4 nerve root. at l5/s1, there is an ovoid area of low-signal intensity which demonstrates minimal enhancement which measures approximately 1 cm ap by 2-3 mm transverse, located medial to the l5 pars intraarticularis, which indents the posterolateral aspect of the thecal sac which is most likely a scar tissue. this causes mild spinal stenosis. at the intervertebral disc space, there is a diffuse disc bulge. there are mild degenerative changes within the facet joints and ligamentous thickening, with asymmetrical narrowing of the left neural foramen and likely compression of the left l5 nerve root.
the patient has undergone cervical fixation from c4 to c7 level as seen on the previous study. there is laminectomy seen from c4 to c7 level. a focal area of increased signal is seen within the spinal cord at c4-5 level as before. following gadolinium administration, diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement is seen along the surface of the cord. the enhancement extends to the posterior fossa. these findings are indicative of diffuse leptomeningeal inflammation. at the level of laminectomy, adherence of the cord to the laminectomy site is noted with increased ventral extra-medullary space. the focus of increased signal within the spinal cord at c4-5 level which is unchanged from the previous study could be secondary to cord edema from leptomeningeal inflammation. there is no definite abscess visualized at the laminectomy site or in the epidural space. the widening of the anterior subarachnoid space in the cervical region appears to be secondary to adhesions. the c4-5 intervertebral disk demonstrates mild increased signal and enhancement. the increased signal seen in the disk space is less apparent than the previous mri of ___. this could be secondary to postoperative change. however, early infection cannot be excluded. near of the spinous process of c7 in the posterior subcutaneous region there is an approximately 1.5 cm irregular area of fluid collection seen with marginal enhancement. this finding is more apparent on the current study. this could be related to a small postoperative fluid collection. however, given the patient's history of fevers, a small abscess cannot be excluded.
there is improved visualization of the cervical spinal canal compared to the previous examination. the cervical cord still remains markedly thin within this canal. there is no change in appearance of the anterior fusion mass. fluid is still demonstrated in the corpectomy site and some fluid extends anteriorly and surrounds the fibular strut graft. this appears reduced compared to ___. a small amount of fluid is noted posteriorly in the fusion site. the course of the vagus nerve is not ideally evaluated. axial images do not show any evidence of sizeable hematoma in the neck. there may soon be some fluid in the right neurovascular sheath.

the t8 and t10 vertebral bodies show elevated t1 signal on the sagittal images. this appearance was also seen on a thoracic spine mr from___, although the more recent studies are not available because of difficulties retrieving those prior images from pacs. a portion of the prior images only from ___, of the thoracic spine could be obtained. comparison with those prior images suggests that the appearance of the known compression fracture of t9, and its accompanying low t1 signal are likely unchanged. marrow signal abnormalities in the adjacent t8 and t10 vertebral bodies, are probably also unchanged, but are not fully characterized on this lumbar spine mr. the lumbar spine shows only minimal degenerative changes, as noted previously. there are schmorl's nodes at t2-3. the previously described accompanying fracture is not well demonstrated on these images. minimal posterior disc bulges at l1-2 and l2-3, where intervertebral disc desiccation is also noted, have a similar appearance. there are no areas of abnormal enhancement to suggest leptomeningeal spread. there are also no signal abnormalities or areas of abnormal enhancement to suggest the presence of an abscess or discitis.
study is limited secondary to patient motion. vertebral bodies are normal in height and alignment. heterogeneous signal intensity is seen on t2-weighted sequences in multiple vertebral bodies secondary to degenerative endplate changes and likely hemangiomas. there is severe desiccation and degenerative change within the t8/9 intervertebral disk, and there is a small posterior osteophytic ridge at this level, more pronounced on the left, but no spinal stenosis. the spinal canal at other levels is capacious, and there is no abnormal t2 signal within the thoracic cord. small bilateral pleural effusions are present.
mr lumbar spine without contrast: l1-l5: no disc bulge or herniation. no central canal or foraminal stenosis. the posterior elements are unremarkable. l5-s1: there is a left paracentral disc protrusion. there is mild central canal stenosis. there is mild-moderate left foraminal stenosis. no right foraminal stenosis. no listhesis. no fracture. the signal arising from within bone marrow is normal. limited assessment of the contents of the retroperitoneum are unremarkable. the regional muscle groups are normal.

no epidural fluid collection is seen to diagnose an abscess. the c2/3 and c3/4 and c4/5 levels are unremarkable. there have been anterior fusions at c5/6 and c6/7 with associated metallic artifact. there is enhancement posterior to the vertebral bodies, in the region of the hematoma shown on ___, and likely related to the surgery. the spinal cord is swollen and centrally t2 hyperintense from the c3/4 to the c7/t1 level. the edema is better seen than on the prior study, perhaps due to decreased motion artifact or may have extended somewhat. at the surgical level, the spinal cord is swollen, filling the thecal sac. it is slightly flattened but there is no high- grade compression of it. there is ventral epidural t2 hyperintensity and enhancement seen on the sagittal images at the inferior aspect of the field of view, at the t1, t2 and t3 levels, which also may be related to the trauma. no fluid collection is seen. given the history, a thoracic spine study is recommended.
from t11-t12 to l4-s5 level, disk degenerative changes are identified. there is no significant disk bulge or herniation seen. there is a rudimentary disk between l5 and s1 indicating sacralization of the l5. there is no evidence of spinal stenosis identified. the distal spinal cord shows normal signal intensities. incidental perineural small cysts are seen within both neural foramina at t11-t12 and t12-l1 levels. the conus is at normal level and exhibits normal signal intensities. there is no evidence of acute compression fracture seen.

at the craniocervical junction and at c2-3, no abnormalities are seen. at c3-4, degenerative disc disease is seen. at c4-5, c5-6 and c6-7, disc bulging and degenerative disc disease is seen. the evaluation for neural foraminal stenosis is somewhat limited due to motion on the axial images, but no evidence of high grade stenosis is seen. there is no evidence of extrinsic spinal cord compression seen. at c7-t1, no abnormalities are noted. the spinal cord demonstrates normal intrinsic signal.
vertebral alignment is unremarkable and there is no evidence of spondylolisthesis. there is mild desiccation of the l5-s1 disc. there is mild bulge of the l4-5 and l5-s1 discs which do not result in significant canal stenosis. there is mild right neural foraminal narrowing at l5-s1. vertebral body and disc heights are otherwise preserved. no signal abnormalities are identified in the distal cord, conus medullaris, and cauda equina. surrounding soft tissues are unremarkable.
again seen are t11 and t12 fractures which are better evaluated on the dedicated thoracic study of the same day. no disc, vertebral or paraspinal pathology is observed in the lumbar spine. there is no spinal stenosis or spondylolisthesis. the visualized distal spinal cord, conus medullaris, and cauda equina are unremarkable. note is made of a right sacral focus of either hemangioma or fatty replacement.

again seen is a moderate t12 vertebral body compression deformity, seen on a prior ct scan of the torso . the bones are diffusely mottled in appearance, especially the sacrum and iliac bones, consistent with osteopenia, as well as the previously demonstrated insufficiency fracture. other than the t12 compression deformity, vertebral body and disc heights are preserved. there is no abnormal signal identified within the vertebral bodies or discs. there is no spinal stenosis or spondylolisthesis. the visualized distal spinal cord, conus medullaris, and cauda equina are unremarkable. note is made of a possibly prominent bladder, as potentially visualized on only one pulse sequence (sagittal t1 images), although there does not appear to be a history of urinary retention.
the conus is positioned at the l1-2 level. the vertebral bodies are normal in height and alignment, with normal signal arising from the bone marrow and from the intervertebral disc spaces. there is no evidence of disc pathology. the spinal canal is widely patent, as are the neural foramina. a region of abnormal signal, perhaps a mass, perhaps edema, is noted within the soft tissues posterior to sacrum. this is incompletely imaged. i may represent dependent edema, although somewhat unusual in that the subcutaneous fat appears non- edematous. there are no paraspinal masses. the soft tissues and paraspinal musculature is grossly unremarkable.
there has been no change in the appearance of the cervical and thoracic spine since the prior exam of ___. this again represents marked interval improvement compared to the ___ exams, at which time there was extensive epidural abscess. multilevel disc degenerative changes are again noted, including posterior disc bulge at the t11-12 level, unchanged in the interval. patient is status post extensive dorsal spine laminectomies. dependent edema is noted along the soft tissues of the back. axial images are degraded by patient motion.
there is persistent increased t2 signal in the l1 and l2 vertebral bodies and the adjacent l1-2 disc space. the endplates at this interspace are irregular and the intervertebral disc is enhancing. previously identified, there was an enhancing epidural abscess posterior to the l2 vertebral body. the focal appearing fluid collection that was previously seen in this location is no longer present. there continues to be enhancement of thickened ventral epidural soft tissue, and some enhancement extending around the margins of the intervertebral space. there is also increased t2 signal and some enhancement in the anterior paraspinal musculature at the l1-2 level and extending inferiorly to the l2-l3 interspace. this appearance is similar to that of the previous study and probably indicates residual paraspinal infection or inflammation. degenerative changes produce spinal canal narrowing at the l3-4 and l4-5 levels. there are no new areas of spinal canal narrowing or abnormal enhancement.
in the region of pons, a well-defined area of signal abnormality consistent with chronic blood products most likely secondary to a cavernous malformation are noted, as seen on the brain mri examination. at the craniocervical junction and at c2-3, no abnormalities are seen. at c3-4, mild disc bulging is noted. at c4-5 and c5-6, no abnormalities are seen. at c6-7, mild disc bulging is seen without spinal stenosis or foraminal narrowing. from c7-t1 to t2-3, no abnormalities are noted. the spinal cord shows normal signal intensities.
there is no evidence of discitis, osteomyelitis, epidural inflammatory collection, or paraspinal abscess in the visualized portions of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine. no signal abnormalities are detected in the cord.
much of the visualized marrow is abnormally t1 and t2 hypointense suggesting an infiltrative process such as metastatic disease. myelofibrosis could have a similar appearance. a radionuclide bone scan is recommended. t5 is t2 hyperintense at the inferior aspect of the field of view. the degenerative cyst in the anterior left aspect of the dens is quite subtle on the mri. lobulated t2- hyperintensity is seen in that region with corresponding t1- hypointensity more consistent with a degenerative cyst than a hemangioma. there is some soft tissue hypertrophy along the posterior margin of the dens without spinal cord compression. as seen on the ct, the c2-3 level is relatively normal with mild bony stenosis of the right foramen. at c3-4, there is a broad-based disc/osteophyte complex. the axial images are somewhat limited, but there is no clear flattening of the spinal cord. the disc is narrowed. the c4-5 disc is also narrowed and there is also a broad-based disc/osteophyte complex, larger on the left than the right. the axial gradient echo images are limited at this level. the t2-weighted images show some flattening of the spinal cord and there is neural foraminal stenosis better evaluated on the ct. the c5-6 disc is also narrowed and there is right worse than left foraminal stenosis. there is some flattening of the spinal cord on the left. at c6-7, the disc is also narrowed. the foraminal stenosis is more accurately evaluated on the ct. there does not appear to be flattening of the spinal cord. the c7-t1 level is normal. the sagittal images are of good quality and no edema is seen in the spinal cord.
from t12-l1 to l5-s1 level, no evidence of significant disc bulge, herniation, or spinal stenosis seen. from t12-s4 level, the vertebral bodies demonstrate normal signal. there is no evidence of discitis, osteomyelitis or intraspinal abscess seen. there is no evidence of intraspinal mass or fluid collection seen. the distal spinal cord shows normal signal intensities. note is made of increased signal in the visualized muscular structures and soft tissues, which could be secondary to generalized edema. free fluid is seen in the pelvis.
the t2 sagittal images again demonstrate mild anterolisthesis of c7 over t1 as seen on the previous ct examination. there is no evidence of prevertebral soft tissue abnormality noted. there is no evidence of intraspinal fluid collection or abnormal signal seen within the spinal cord on the motion limited images.
the entire cervical and thoracic spines are imaged in the sagittal plane only. these images again show spondylytic changes of the mid to lower cervical spine with multilevel involvement and mild impression on the thecal sac. however, the appearance is unchanged. there is no obvious compression of the spinal cord, or of abscess or fluid collection. below t4, there are laminectomies extending throughout the inferior thoracic spine. assessment for intradural inflammation is not possible with this limited set of images.
the spinal cord ends at the level of l1-l2. normal signal is seen within the visualized portion of the spinal cord. no abnormal epidural collections are seen. no abnormal enhancement is identified within the lumbar spine. the vertebral bodies are normal in height and alignment. degenerative change is seen with loss of the vertebral disc space signal diffusely within the lumbar spine that is most prominent at the levels of l3-4, l4-5, and l5- s1. there is significant loss of intervertebral disc space height at the level of l5-s1. a laminectomy has been performed at l5. an incidental note is made of a bone island within the right iliac bone adjacent to the sacroiliac joints. at the level of l2-3 and l3-4, no significant spinal canal or neuroforaminal narrowing is seen. at the level of l4-5, there is a annular tear, a mild broad-based disc bulge, and degenerative change within the facet joints without resultant spinal canal or neuroforaminal narrowing. at the level of l5-s1, there is evidence of l5 laminectomy. soft tissue is present in the region of the left neural foramen that is unchanged compared to ___. an osteophyte also extend in the region of the left neural foramen. the left neural foramen is patent. no spinal canal or right neuroforaminal narrowing is seen.
postoperative changes are again noted. the posterior stabilization hardware from the occiput to c6 is not well assessed due to the associated susceptibility artifacts. c3-5 corpectomies are noted. metal hardware has been placed anterior to the inferior end of the fibular strut graft. at the inferior plate of c2, there are small osseous fragments, and there is associated increased stir signal within the t2 vertebral body compatible with edema. note is made of a small amount of fluid interposed between the superior end of the fibular strut graft and the inferior end plate of c2. a fluid collection is again noted around corpectomy bed. comparison with the prior ct examinations is limited, but this collection does not seem any worse than in prior studies. there is no encroachment of the spinal canal at this time. the spinal cord is not compressed.
at the l3/4 level, there is a large fluid collection. it extends into the posterior paravertebral soft tissues adjacent to the facet joint measuring approximately 3.5 cm on each side. there is extension into a large midline subcutaneous collection that measures approximately 2.8 x 3.5 cm. in addition, there is epidural extension of a fluid collection, presumably abscess that extends superiorly to at least the t11 level and inferiorly to the l5 level. the l3/4 facet joints are very irregular. additional smaller and probably interconnected fluid collections are present in the expanded right psoas muscle, extending into the pelvis along the course of the iliopsoas. the inferior extent of this iliopsoas abscess is not imaged. at l3/4, there also appears to be an annular tear and small disc protrusion. at l4/l5, there is a diffuse disc bulge. findings were discussed with dr. ___ on the morning of examination at approximately 11 a.m.
there is subtle increased signal seen within the inferior portion of c2 vertebral body consistent with a fracture seen on the ct. mild prevertebral soft tissue edema is also identified. the interspinous region at this level demonstrates slight increased signal on the inversion recovery images indicative of edema and trauma to the soft tissues. there is no evidence of disruption of the interspinous or anterior or posterior longitudinal ligament seen. the vertebral flow voids bilaterally are maintained throughout the cervical spine and at the c2 level. from c2-3 to c4-5 degenerative disc disease is seen. at c5-6 and c6-7 mild bulging is noted. from c7-t1 to t3-4 mild degenerative changes are seen. the spinal cord demonstrates normal signal without extrinsic compression or intrinsic signal abnormalities. no evidence of intraspinal fluid collection seen.
marked right convexity scoliosis of the lumbar spine is noted. fusion hardware fixates the l3-l4 vertebral bodies, obscuring detail on several images in this area. no abnormal enhancing epidural, prevertebral, or paraspinal soft tissue masses/collections are identified. severe disc desiccation and loss of height is noted at l2-3, l3-4, and l4-l5. at l1-l2, l2-l3, and l3-l4, there is marked endplate osteophyte formation without neural foraminal or spinal canal stenosis. at l4-l5, lateral facet and endplate osteophytes and/or bulging disc compromise the lateral foraminal and extraforaminal portions of the l4 nerve root. the facet osteophytes also appear to mildly narrow the spinal canal due to facet osteophyte proliferation. however, the above findings may be accentuated by geometric distortion from metallic artifact. at l5-s1, intervertebral osteophytes and mild disc bulge mildly narrows the left neural foramen. facet proliferation on the right compresses the exiting l5 nerve root.
at the craniocervical junction and at c2-3, no abnormalities are seen. at c3-4 and c4-5, mild disc bulging and degenerative disc disease with anterior osteophytes is seen without spinal stenosis or foraminal narrowing. at c5-6, there is disc bulging and uncovertebral degenerative change. mild stenosis of right neural foramen is noted. at c6-7, there is disc bulging and uncovertebral degenerative change with moderate narrowing of both neural foramina. at c7-t1 to t3-4, degenerative disc disease is seen without spinal stenosis. the spinal cord shows normal signal intensities. no evidence of extrinsic spinal cord compression seen.
vertebral body alignment and intervertebral disc signal is within normal limits. the spinal canal and neural foramina are widely patent. there is no evidence of spinal fracture or hematoma.
there is no clear evidence of impingement on the conus or cauda equina by soft tissue or bony abnormality. a midline defect is observed in the posterior soft tissues of the lower lumbar spine, and there is fluid within the subcutaneous soft tissue and irregularity of signal within the midline musculature, where the laminectomy occurred. on the sagittal t2-weighted scans, it appears that there may be continuity from the spinal canal into the subcutaneous soft tissue collection, and a csf leak cannot be excluded. there is no abnormal enhancement of the bones, discs or epidural space to suggest spinal infection at this time.
interval c3 to c5 corpectomy has been performed, replaced by a fibular strut graft extending along the anterior margin of the resected osseous spinal column. posterior to the strut graft is material with a heterogeneous t2 signal, and which fills the rest of the corpectomy space. persistent convex bulge of the posterior longitudinal ligament continues to severely narrow the central spinal canal, with negligible improvement. also, heterogeneously high t2 signal collection is found in the prevertebral soft tissues at the level of surgery. as noted on prior studies, there is marked atrophy of the cervical spinal cord from a prior resection of an ependymoma. anterolisthesis of the c2 vertebral body on c3 is unchanged. posterior fusion hardware extending from the occiput to the c6 vertebral body level is again noted. compared to the prior head mri of ___, there is new irregular increased t2 signal intensity within the right cerebellar hemisphere.
again, at l1-2 level endplate signal changes are seen with subtle enhancement indicative of improving changes of diskitis and osteomyelitis. there are subtle epidural enhancement seen at this level without evidence of epidural abscess. overall, there has been improvement since the previous study. again, multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the lumbar region with spinal stenosis most pronounced at l3-4 level. there is again endplate changes identified on the left side with increased signal along the endplates and paraspinal soft tissues at t10-11 level. the distal spinal cord shows normal signal intensities. there is no evidence of new area of intraspinal fluid collection or evidence of new involvement with diskitis or osteomyelitis seen.
cervical spinal cord injury is identified at the c2-3 level, in the location of known fracture and stenosis. the spinal cord is compressed, and exhibits increased t2 signal and central susceptibility artifact, findings consistent with edema and hemorrhage. osseous fragments are present in the posterolateral spinal canal at the level of c2 and c3. there is the appearance of a subligamentous fluid collection posterior to the c2 and c3 vertebral bodies. there is also a small amount of prevertebral edema evident, but mostly obscured by the presence of endotracheal and nasopharyngeal tubes. there is edema throughout the right lateral and posterior cervical soft tissues and extending between and through muscle bundles. there does not appear to be spinal canal stenosis at the lower levels of the cervical spine. there is no anteroposterior malalignment evident.
the image quality of this examination is limited. there is apparent abnormal signal surrounding the thecal sac in the upper cervical spine, but the extent of this abnormality is not definitely discerned. this abnormality does correlate with the previously reported subdural hematoma extending through the foramen magnum into the upper cervical spinal canal. there does not appear to be any significant cord compression. prevertebral soft tissue thickening is present, probably representing blood and/or edema. multilevel spondylytic changes are identified. findings were discussed with dr. ___ ___ on the day of the study at 17:00 hours.
motion artifact blurs detail. the thoracic vertebrae are normally aligned. there are no compression deformities of the bones. at t12-l1, there is a disc protrusion which indents the ventral thecal sac and produces mild spinal canal narrowing. within the superior endplate of t12, there is slightly increased t2 signal. there is decreased t2 signal in the endplates at the t12-l1 level. these findings may reflect degenerative change. there is no clear evidence of discitis or osteomyelitis. post-gadolinium images demonstrate a slightly prominent enhancement of the distal ventral epidural space on the sagittal scans, but this cannot be clearly appreciated as an abnormality in the axial plane due to excessive patient motion. images of the lumbosacral spine include sagittal pre- and post-gadolinium t1- weighted scans, t2-weighted scans, inversion recovery images and pre- and post-gadolinium t1-weighted axial images and post-gadolinium t1-weighted sagittal images. no previous studies are available for comparison.
in conjunction with the exam of ___, these fat suppressed axial sequences demonstrate apparent signal dropout in the prevertebral soft tissues, suggesting that the previously described prevertebral soft tissue abnormality at the c2 and c3 levels represents fat.
sagittal images demonstrate a slight kyphotic deformity of the cervical spine due to multilevel degenerative change. the end plates exhibit osteophyte formation and discs are desiccated and protruding at some levels. there is no impingement on the cervicomedullary junction. the spinal canal is not narrowed at the c2-3 level. axial images at c3-4 demonstrate bilateral uncovertebral spondylosis with severe spinal canal and neuroforaminal stenosis. at c4-5, there is also uncovertebral spondylosis and moderate spinal canal stenosis. the neural foramina are difficult to assess due to motion artifact, but they are likely narrowed bilaterally. at the c5-6, there is also endplate osteophyte formation with mild spinal canal narrowing and possibly neuroforaminal stenosis. at c6-7, there is an endplate osteophytic ridge again indenting the thecal sac. images at this level are markedly degraded. this c7-t1 interspace is also poorly seen. there are no definite signal abnormalities within the vertebrae to suggest the presence of an infiltrative process.
new susceptibility artifacts are present along the posterior cervical spine secondary to interval hardware placement for fusion from the occiput through c6. these artifacts limit some of the visible detail. the degree of anterolisthesis of c2 on c3 remains similar in appearance. again noted is the reversal of the cervical lordosis. there is now apparent obliteration of the spinal canal from c2 through c5, obscuring the atrophic cervical cord. multilevel degenerative changes are again noted. swelling in the soft tissues of the posterior neck is compatible with interval surgical intervention.
the t2-weighted sagittal mri is unremarkable. the alignment is normal. no marrow, disc or paraspinal pathology is seen.
there has been a central laminectomy at l5-s1. there is no evidence of canal stenosis or recurrent disc herniation at this level. there is a small left-sided annular tear at l4-5. there is no evidence of focal disc protrusion. there is no evidence of canal or foraminal stenosis. there is no definite evidence of disc infection or epidural abscess. the remaining lumbar levels are not remarkable.
no abnormal signal along the cervical and thoracic courses of the spinal canal. a 1-cm focus of hyperintensity on both t1- and t2-weighted images is seen at the right side of the t3 vertebral body level, with appearances most likely representing hemangioma. no evidence of vertebral osteomyelitis, subdural, or epidural abscess. cord signal intensity values are grossly normal. there appears to be mild degenerative disc change at the c5-6 level, although this examination is not tailored to quantify the degenerative changes.
there is no evidence of intraspinal collection, abnormal enhancement, or cord compression. although only sagittal images are provided, there is no overt neural foraminal abnormalities or evidence of disc herniations or protrusions. there is a 1 cm high intensity lesion seen on the post-contrast images in the t12 vertebral body, not clearly within the imaged field of view on the other sequences. in addition, a 4 mm hyperintensity seen on both the t1- and t2-weighted images is seen within the posterior aspect of the l3 vertebral body. two hyperintensities on both t1- and t2-weighted images are seen within the s1 vertebral body, each approximately 1 cm in size.
the study is limited study as the cervical, thoracic spine was performed with large field of view. the vertebrae are normal in height and alignment. heterogeneous marrow noted within the vertebral bodies most probably physiologic of uncertain etiology. no abnormal enhancing lesions noted. no definite evidence of infection noted. mild degenerative disc disease is noted in the lower cervical spine with mild spinal stenosis.
the study is severely limited by motion. the vertebrae appear to be grossly within normal height and alignment. there is straightening of the cervical spine noted maybe related to spasm. slight positioning. disc desiccation is noted in all the cervical disc spaces. evaluation of the spinal cord is minimally limited due to motion. a subtle abnormality within the cord cannot be excluded. at the level of c4-5, there is facet and uncinate hypertrophy noted thereby causing mild neural canal narrowing bilaterally. the remainder of the disc spaces demonstrates no significant central or neural canal stenosis.
in the interval since the previous examination, there has been further degenerative change of the lower lumbar intervertebral discs and endplates. there is now a slight retrolisthesis of l3 with respect to l2 and l4. there is further narrowing of the l2-3, l3-4 and l4-5 disc spaces and further endplate degenerative change at these levels. no definite bony signal abnormalities to suggest the presence of metastatic disease are identified. axial images through the l2-3 level demonstrate a bulging disc and mild facet degenerative change, stable since the previous study. there is mild right neural foraminal narrowing at this level. at l3-4, there is a bulging disc, with a leftward protrusion that extends into the epidural space and indents the left ventral lateral thecal sac. there is impingement upon the left l4 nerve root within its lateral recess due to this disc protrusion. there is also moderate to severe narrowing of the left l3-4 neural foramen. the right neural foramen is not stenotic. the spinal canal is mildly narrowed due to protruding disc material. the facet joint complexes at this level demonstrate mild degenerative change. at l4-5, there is a diffusely bulging disc and there is mild-to-moderate facet degenerative change. this produces moderate degree of spinal canal stenosis. there is also left neural foraminal narrowing. the right neural foramen does not appear stenotic. at l5-s1, there is a disc protrusion which indents the ventral thecal sac. the spinal canal does not appear stenotic. the facet joints are moderately enlarged bilaterally. on the left, there is moderate foraminal narrowing due to facet osteophyte formation. on the right, there is mild foraminal narrowing. there is a focus of t1 and t2 signal hyperintensity in the right ilium, which could be a site of fatty infiltration. post-gadolinium images reveal no abnormal intraspinal enhancement. there is no abnormal enhancement of the bones or discs appreciated.
the actual fracture lines in c2 seen on the prior ct are not clearly visualized on this examination. evaluation of the vertebral bodies demonstrate elevated stir signal within the c2 vertebral body, representing edema associated with the fractures in that bone. in addition, the fracture line of the c7 spinal process is seen, with mild distraction at the fracture site. diffuse high signal is seen on the stir images in the tissues posterior to the c2- c6 levels, as well as at the paraspinal muscles at and below the c6 level. no evidence of focal distortion at the cervical extent of the spinal cord is noted.
in the cervical region no evidence of fracture or marrow edema is seen. there is no evidence of ligamentous disruption seen. the alignment is normal. the spinal cord demonstrates normal signal. there is disk bulging at c6-7 level. in the visualized upper thoracic region marrow edema is seen at the superior endplate of t3 which could be due to mild compression. limited evaluation of the thoracic spine on the scout images of the thoracic spine demonstrates compression of t10 vertebra as seen on the ct of ___. there is no abnormal widening of the intrapinous distances seen. however, evaluation is limited for ligamentous injury.
at the craniocervical junction and at c2-3, no abnormalities are noted. at c3-4, mild disc bulging and uncovertebral degenerative changes are noted with moderate right foraminal stenosis without compromise of the left neural foramen. at c4-5, disc bulging and moderate right foraminal stenosis is seen without compromise of the left neural foramen. at c5-6, disc and uncovertebral degenerative changes are seen with mild-to- moderate stenosis of the right foramen and mild bulging indenting the thecal sac. at c6-7, disc bulging and degenerative disc disease are noted. mild bilateral foraminal stenosis is seen. at c7-t1 to t3-4, degenerative disc disease is noted without spinal stenosis. following gadolinium administration, no abnormal intraspinal enhancement is identified. the spinal cord demonstrates no evidence of extrinsic compression or intrinsic signal abnormalities.
since the prior study, the patient has undergone laminectomies and removal of spinous process of the l3 level. there is the expected soft tissue enhancement in the bony defect. posterior to the dura, there is a flat, curvilinear band of fluid signal intensity, that does not enhance. there is thin enhancement along its anterior margin. posteriorly, it abuts the expected thick postoperative epidural enhancement. obviously infection of the fluid cannot be excluded. the absence of mass effect is somewhat reassuring, however. at the surgical levels, the dura bulges posteriorly, into the surgical defect. there is new edema in the l3 vertebral body and in the posterior inferior right aspect of l2. this bone marrow edema is highly suggestive of osteomyelitis. there is thick epidural enhancement along the dorsal surface of l3, extending superiorly to l2 where it extends into the right foramen, surrounding the previously present small disc protrusion. the right paraspinal edema seen on the axial t2-weighted images from the mid aspect of l2, tracking down in the psoas muscle to the inferior aspect of the field of view, has improved. currently, psoas edema is discernible at the l3 and l4 levels. on the post-contrast axial t1-weighted images, there remains a small area of nonenhancing fluid that currently measures 4 mm as compared to 8 mm on the prior study. the nonenhancing fluid corresponds to the central aspect of a larger well-defined area of t2 hyperintensity in the right psoas muscle. previously, there was extensive ill-defined edema in this region. the thick epidural enhancement at the l3 level indents the thecal sac on the right and might affect the right l4 nerve root. the foraminal abnormalities at l3/4 and l4/5 could affect the right l3 and l4 nerve roots as well.

the images are of limited quality due to excessive patient motion. signal abnormality projecting over the cervical and thoracic cord is likely related to the motion artifact. there is no evidence of cord compression. the vertebral body signal and intervertebral disc signal is grossly normal.
the vertebrae are normal in height and alignment and signal intensity. the distal spinal cord is unremarkable. disc desiccation is noted in all the lumbar disc spaces. at the level of l4-5: diffuse disc bulge noted with facet and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy thereby causing mild central canal stenosis. no significant neural canal stenosis noted. there is a questionable increased signal noted within the l5-s1 disc, which appears to be faintly enhancing on contrast administration. this is a nonspecific finding.
compared to the previous study there is minimal new and prevertebral edema identified extending from c3-c5 level adjacent to the anterior aspect of the vertebral body. there is also mild increased signal seen in the posterior soft tissues from occiput to c4-c5 level. however, there is no evidence of disruption of the intraspinous, posterior longitudinal or anterior longitudinal ligaments seen. again there is congenital fusion of c2 and c3 visualized. there is moderate- to-severe stenosis seen at c3-4 level due to disc bulging and ligamentous thickening. there is subtle increased signal visualized within the spinal cord immediately below the level of the stenosis at c4 and c5 level on the sagittal inversion recovery and axial t2 images which are slightly limited by motion. again multilevel degenerative changes are identified. old compression of t3 vertebra is seen. there is no evidence of intraspinal hematoma or fluid collection.
again, signal abnormalities are noted at l3-4 level. there is some enhancement seen in this region. an area of low signal within the disc could be secondary to postoperative change or air within the disc. the marrow edema seen in the l3 and l4 vertebral bodies indicates discitis and osteomyelitis. additionally, there is increased signal seen within the l4-5 disc with subtle signal abnormalities at the superior endplate of l5. this finding is new since the previous study. however, it is unclear whether this is secondary to new osteomyelitis at l4-5 level as the evaluation is limited due to motion artifacts. there is no evidence of a well-defined intraspinal abscess identified. laminectomies are seen in the upper lumbar region.
edema is noted within the interspinous ligaments consistent with ligamentous injury along the posterior elements. edema is also noted in the prevertebral soft tissues from the level of c1-c5 and c6-t1. there is asymmetric anterior widening of the c6-7 interspace with edema in the disc space, raising a suspicion of tear of the anterior longitudinal ligament. findings are all consistent with hyperextension injury. focal increased t2 signal is noted within the extra-axial space at the level of c6-7 likely represents a localized hematoma with posterior displacement and possible compression of the cord. no obvious cord signal is noted to suggest edema within the cord. subtle subdural spinal hematoma is also noted at the level of the anterior aspect of the spinal cord extending all along the anterior cervical spinal canal and up to the level of the upper thoracic spine.

there is widening of the prevertebral soft tissues extending from the skull base to c4 level indicating prevertebral hematoma. there is increased signal seen superior to the odontoid process and within bilateral atlantoaxial joints and left atlantooccipital joint. these findings indicate soft tissue changes and fluid within the joints from fracture of c1 vertebra seen on the ct. of concern is absence of flow void within the left vertebral artery on the axial t2-weighted images. subtle increased signal is identified in the upper cervical spinal cord on sagittal t1 and inversion-recovery and axial t2- weighted images, which could be suggestive of early ischemia of the spinal cord. subtle increased signal is seen in relation with the c6 vertebral body on inversion-recovery images, which could reflect the fracture seen on the ct. there is no evidence of disruption of the posterior longitudinal, anterior longitudinal or interspinous ligament seen. increased signal is seen in the posterior soft tissues from occiput to c4 level indicating soft tissue trauma.
an area of increased signal is seen within the inferior portion of partially visualized t11 vertebral body. a subtle area of increased signal is seen in the anterior portion of l2 vertebral body. a questionable signal abnormality is also seen in the l5 vertebral body. these findings are suspicious for new small areas of bony metastatic lesions. however, there is no evidence of pathological fracture seen and there is no evidence of intraspinal mass or thecal sac compression identified. again, a schmorl's node is seen at l2-3 level. there is no evidence of disc herniation or spinal stenosis seen. the distal spinal cord shows normal signal intensities.

again noted is fracture and vertebral body height loss at the l4 level, with retro pulsion of the posterior fragment, unchanged in appearance since the ___ exam. there is grade 1 retrolisthesis of l1 on l2, and l2 on l3. there is trace retrolisthesis of l4 on l5. the conus is positioned at the level of the superior aspect of l2, somewhat low. there are posterior disc bulges at the l1-2, l2-3, l3-4, and l4-5 levels posteriorly. again, incidentally noted is a cyst at the upper pole of the left kidney measuring 1 cm. gallstones noted. at the t12-l1 level, no neuroforaminal or spinal canal narrowing is noted. at the l1-2 level, there is a broad-based disc bulge, which contacts the thecal sac and causes moderate to moderately severe narrowing of the spinal canal. there is also mild right neural foraminal narrowing. the left neural foramen is widely patent. at the l2-3 level, there is a broad-based disc bulge which contacts the thecal sac resulting in moderately severe spinal stenosis. there is moderate right and mild left neural foraminal narrowing. a puntate high t2 focus within the spnial canal abutting the inferior edge of the l2 vertebral body is noted, of uncertain etiology, but doubtful clinical significance. at the l3-4 level, there is also a broad-based disc bulge, which severely narrows the spinal canal, completely distorting the thecal sac and elongating it in an ap dimension. some facet degenerative changes also present at this level which also narrow the spinal canal. there is moderate right and moderately severe left neural foraminal narrowing resulting from both the facet degenerative change and the disc bulge. at the l4-5 level, there is a small broad-based disk bulge, asymmetric to the left posterolaterally, which severely narrows the left neural foramen, mild to moderately narrows the spinal canal, and moderately narrows the right neural foramen. at the l5-s1 level, there is no significant spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing. disk desiccation is present at multiple levels. fluid is noted within the l2-3 disc interspace. similar fluid is also noted at the l3-4 disc space level. there are no accompanying signs of edema within the vertebral bodies and the endplates are preserved. minimal edema associated with an osteophyte along the anteroinferior corner of l3 is likely degenerative. of note, there is an abnormal fluid collection, anterior to the lumbosacral junction, predominantly on the right but extending across the midline. the signal characteristics on the t1w images are compatible with hematoma. this fluid collection was described on the ___ ct scan, but the ct appearance was not specific for hemorrhage. the collection is probably not larger than on ___ and may very well be slightly smaller, but cannot be directly compared because it is incompletely included on this examination.
the conus is appropriately positioned at t12/l1. vertebral bodies show heterogeneous signal intensity, likely reflecting multifocal endplate changes. at l1/2, there is equivocal retrolisthesis of l1. there is a diffuse disc bulge at this level but no significant spinal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing. at l2/3, there is also an equivocal amount of retrolisthesis of l2 upon l3, and a diffuse disc bulge with mild spinal stenosis but no overt neural foraminal narrowing. at l3/4, there is a diffuse disc bulge with moderate spinal stenosis but no significant neural foraminal narrowing. at l4/5, there is also a diffuse disc bulge with moderate spinal stenosis. there is moderate ligamentum flavum thickening and moderate degenerative changes within the facet joints at this level. at l5/s1, there is also moderate ligamentum flavum thickening and degenerative changes within the facet joints, along with a diffuse posterior disc bulge and mild associated spinal stenosis.

at c6-7 level, there is widening of the disc space anteriorly with increased signal within the disc. there is increased signal seen in the prevertebral region extending from c6-7 inferiorly to t4 level. these findings indicate disruption of the anterior longitudinal ligament from extension injury. there is no significant marrow edema seen in the vertebral bodies. the patient is known to have fracture of the lamina of c6, which is not apparent on the mri. increased signal is seen within the facet joint on the right side at c6-7 level which could be related to the fracture. there is also increased signal seen in the posterior soft tissues related to trauma. there is no evidence of disruption of the posterior longitudinal or interspinous ligaments. there is increased signal seen within the spinal cord at c6 level with a small area of low signal on suceptibility images, which could be secondary to cord edema/contusion. there is no intraspinal hematoma seen. there are cervical changes of cervical spondylosis with moderate spinal stenosis and indentation on the cord at c3-4 and c4-5 levels. the multilevel degenerative changes are also seen at the other levels in the cervical region. there is partial fusion of the disc at c5-6 level.

grade 2 anterolisthesis of the l4 vertebral body on l5 is unchanged from ___. the central spinal canal is widened at the l4 level, suggesting this spondylolisthesis is due to pars interarticularis defects, though these are not well visualized on this mr study. the lumbar vertebral body heights and signal are maintained. intervertebral disc spaces are maintained at all levels except at l4/5. at this level, there is disc space narrowing similar to that seen on ___. however, in the interim, elevated t2 signal as well as elevated stir signal has developed; thus, early discitis cannot be excluded at this level. the adjacent vertebral body end plates are intact. there is severe neural foraminal stenosis bilaterally at this level related to the lytic spondylolisthesis. there is decreased t1 and t2 signal at the l5/s1 disc, consistent with desiccation. the central spinal canal appears patent. the conus medullaris is located at l1. there are no disc protrusions. no overt paraspinal pathology is visualized. there is no evidence of epidural abscess.
there is marked scoliosis of the lumbar spine convex left centered at l3-l4 level. the conus medullaris terminates at l1. axial scans were obtained from t12 through s1. t12-l1 level shows no evidence of spinal stenosis or disc protrusion. the neural foramina are patent at this level. l1-l2 level shows modest spinal stenosis with mild left l1-l2 neural foraminal stenosis. l2-l3 and l3-l4 levels show moderate spinal stenosis with bilateral l2-l3 and right l3-l4 neural foraminal stenosis. l4-l5 level shows severe spinal stenosis with bilateral lateral recess and neural foraminal stenosis. l5-s1 level shows modest spinal stenosis with severe left l5-s1 neural foraminal stenosis. the lumbar vertebral bodies show extensive degenerative endplate changes with dorsal osteophytes worse at l3-l4, l4-l5, and l5-s1 levels. there is diffuse facet osteoarthritis. the right kidney shows multiple cysts, the largest one measures approximately 6 cm. there is probable associated hydronephrosis; ultrasound can be obtained for further evaluation.
there is diffuse low signal seen within the visualized bony structures, which could be secondary to marrow hyperplasia or infiltrative process. endplate signal changes are seen in the lumbar region. mild disc degenerative changes are noted without significant disc bulge, herniation or spinal stenosis. there is no evidence of high-grade foraminal narrowing seen. there is no evidence of pathologic fracture seen. following gadolinium, no evidence of abnormal enhancement is seen. no intraspinal mass identified. paraspinal soft tissues are unremarkable.
sagittal images of the cervical spine demonstrate normal vertebral alignment. vertebral body height and signal is maintained. there is thickening of the soft tissues of the c1-2 joint space. this may be degenerative in nature, but infection cannot be excluded, as there is enhancement in this location. however, there is no clear evidence of abnormal epidural enhancement in the cervical spinal canal. there was identified and is again seen, a posterior cervical deep soft tissue multiloculated collection with a thickly enhancing rim. the superior extent of this abnormality is roughly at the level of c7 and it extends into the thoracic region, located just to the left of midline in the posterior subcutaneous musculature. the craniocaudal length of this area of enhancing abnormal fluid is roughly 8 cm. otherwise, the cervical spinal canal is not stenotic. the cervical spinal cord is normal in caliber. views of the thoracic spine demonstrate compression deformities of t7, t8, t9, and to a mild degree t10. the t9 vertebral body is markedly abnormal with decreased t1 signal and irregularly increased t2 signal throughout this vertebra and involving the adjacent disc spaces. there is also a prevertebral t2 hyperintense mass extending anterior to the vertebral body and encompassing adjacent disc spaces. this is indenting the posterior mediastinum. there is irregular enhancement of the t9 vertebral body and the margins of the prevertebral abnormality, suggesting that it is an abscess with associated peripheral inflammatory change. there is also a right pleural effusion which exhibits some enhancement along its margins and is associated with atelectasis of the adjacent lung. additionally, within the spinal canal, primarily at the t9 level, but also slightly above and below, there is abnormal circumferential epidural enhancement. this is suspicious for infection in the epidural space. the spinal canal is mildly narrowed at the t9 level due to the compression deformity of the bone and epidural abnormality. there is no cord compression.
the vertebral body heights are well maintained. a mixed density fat and soft tissue lesion within the s1 vertebral body is consistent with a hemangioma. the conus terminates normally at l1 and has normal signal characteristics. there is multilevel degenerative change with disc desiccation at all levels. there is grade-1 retrolisthesis of l2 on l3 with a central disc protrusion causing moderate canal stenosis and bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. at l3-4, there is a mild disc bulge. there is also mild facet hypertrophy at this level. however, no evidence of spinal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing is noted. grade-1 anterolisthesis of l4 on l5 is also identified. a central disc protrusion at this level causes bilateral neural foraminal narrowing with moderate spinal stenosis. at l5-s1, a mild disc bulge produces slight indentation of the thecal sac. the visualized paraspinal soft tissue is unremarkable. the distal spinal cord shows normal signal intensities.
in the interim since the prior examination, there has been an extensive laminectomy at c4, c5, c6 and c7. anterior fusion hardware at c4, c5 and c6 remain in place. there is partial, congenital osseous fusion of c7 and t1 vertebral bodies. there is extensive patient motion on the gradient echo sequences and poor signal-to-noise ratio on these images, and therefore the degree of potential neural foraminal stenosis cannot be assessed. however, there has been interval reduction of the ap diameter of the subarachnoid space cephalad to the area of laminectomy. particularly at the c2-3 level, there is interval decrease in the subarachnoid space diameter, the space now appearing effaced. the ligamentum flavum is contacting the cord at this level. signal within the spinal cord itself remains within normal limits.
again scoliosis of lumbar spine is seen. at t12-l1, increased signal is seen within the disc with some enhancement indicative of discitis. there is abnormal signal seen in the adjacent endplates indicative of marrow edema. again paraspinal soft tissue abnormalities with fluid collection are seen indicative of abscess. compared to the prior study, the paraspinal fluid collections have slightly decreased. the persistent signal changes and slight enhancement within the disc could be secondary to evolution of inflammatory change within the disc and ___ not necessarily indicate worsening of discitis. further followup is therefore essential. there is no evidence of new inflammatory changes seen within the spinal canal. increased signal is seen within the l1-2 and l2-3 discs on the inversion recovery images which was not identified on the previous study. there is no enhancement seen in this region. this finding ___ be secondary to technical differences or due to fluid within the disc from increased motion. further followup is recommended to exclude inflammation at this level. mild degenerative changes and bulging from l3-4 to l5-s1 level are again noted. the distal spinal cord shows normal signal intensities. no evidence of compression of the distal cord is seen.
from t11-12 to l5-s1 level, disc degenerative changes are identified. there is mild disc bulging seen at these levels without spinal stenosis. there is no evidence of high-grade foraminal narrowing seen. mild right foraminal stenosis is seen at l4-5 level. there is a hemangioma visualized in the l5 vertebral body and a schmorl node is seen in the right side of l3 vertebral body. the distal spinal cord shows normal signal intensities. there are no focal bony signal abnormalities seen to indicate metastatic disease. there is no intraspinal mass or abnormal enhancement seen. note is made of multiple retroperitoneal lymph nodes, which were noted on the previous abdominal ct and correlation with ct is recommended.
in the c6 inferior endplate, in the inferoposterior aspect, there is an area of rim with central decreased enhancement seen on series 8, image 7 and image 9. adjacent to this level, anterior and posterior to the cervical vertebral column, there are two collections with nonenhancing centers centered around the intervertebral disc space c6/c7. these collections are presumably representing abscesses with liquefactive, nonenhancing centers. the anterior collection appears to extend cranially up to t2 or possibly even higher and caudally appears to extend down in the posterior mediastinum. the maximum thickness of the collection is centered at the c6/c7 level and measures approximately 10 mm in ap diameter. the collection posterior to the c6-c7 level in the epidural space also appears to extend cranially with dorsal dural enhancement seen up to level of the visualized level of the skull base. there is significant compression of the spinal cord with the epidural collection occupying approximately 75% of the spinal canal cross-sectional area. the collection is centered at the c6-c7 level. the maximum thickness of the epidural abscess is approximately 9 mm at this level. the epidural collection that is seen anteriorly at the described levels spirals around the spinal cord at the level c7/t1 and then extends caudally posterior to the spinal cord to approximately level of t5. caudally however there is still dural contrast enhancement indicating inflammation, more caudally. the maximum thickness of the posterior component of the epidural abscess is approximately 7 mm or 50% of the spinal canal area. there is significant anterior displacement and also slight compression of the cervical cord. most concerning however are several small round foci of t2 hyperintensity seen at the level of c7-c8 within the spinal cord which then appear to form a single short-segment tubular high-density structure within the anterior intramedullary substance, reaching down to the level of t1/t2. there is a faint rim of contrast enhancement around this t2 bright area within the cord substance, that suggests the presence of an intramedullary abscess. there is slight abnormal kyphotic angle within the cervical spine. the alignment of the vertebral bodies however is grossly normal. the intervertebral disc spaces are grossly preserved. at the level of c6-c7, there appears to be somewhat more irregular contours of the vertebral endplates. as mentioned, there is a hypointense focus at the posterior inferior aspect of c6 on the t1 contrast sagittal images, which raises the suspicion that infectious process may have its origin at this location and then subsequently caused spreading in the multiple compartments as described.

there is a small, focal central disc protrusion seen at the level of l2/3 with mild superior extrusion. there is mild-to-moderate compression of the thecal sac. multilevel degenerative changes are present, the most prominent are seen at the endplates of the l3/4 interspace and l4/5 interspaces. mild disc bulges are seen at the l2/3-l4/5 levels. these bulging discs cause mild bilateral l2/3 and moderate bilateral l3/4 and l4/5 neural foraminal narrowing. at l5/s1, facet joint degeneration causes moderate bilateral foraminal narrowing. all lumbar discs are moderately desiccated. no evidence of abnormal enhancement is seen and there is no evidence for abscess.
as noted in the thoracic spine mri, there is a large epidural hematoma in the right posterolateral spinal canal extending from t7-8 down to the l3-4 disc space. this is heterogeneous t1 and t2 signal with only minimal peripheral enhancement. there is a fluid-fluid level present within the collection. this supports the diagnosis of an epidural hematoma. there is no paraspinal or soft tissue abnormality. there is no evidence of discitis. no additional enhancing abnormalities are identified. there appears to be severe spinal canal narrowing down to the l3 level. however, no increased t2 signal is noted within the cord. there are areas of focal fatty infiltration or hemangiomas within the l3, 4 and 5 vertebral bodies. incidental note is made of small scattered cysts within the kidneys.
there is increased lumbar lordosis identified. from t11-12 to l2-3, no abnormalities are seen. at l3-4, disc degenerative changes and mild bulging is seen. at l4-5, no abnormalities are identified. at l5-s1 level, there is minimal spondylolisthesis of l5 over s1 with bilateral spondylolysis of l5. there is no evidence of increased signal seen in the intra-articular region of l5 on inversion recovery images. the spondylolysis was seen on the previous abdominal ct of ___ and therefore is chronic in nature. there is uncovering of the disc at this level without focal disc herniation or compression of the exiting l5 nerve roots. the distal spinal cord shows normal signal intensities.
the patient has undergone laminectomies at c3, c4 and c5 level at the craniocervical junction and c2-3 and c3-4 degenerative disc disease is seen. the spinal canal is patent. at c4-5 there is a large central and left paracentral disc herniation identified which extends both superiorly and inferiorly. there is thickening of the ligaments posteriorly. this combination of changes result in severe spinal stenosis and compression of the spinal cord. there is moderate-to- severe narrowing of the left and moderate narrowing of the right neural foramen. at c4-5 disc degenerative change and a small left-sided disc herniation are seen which slightly indents the left side of the spinal cord. mild-to-moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis is seen. at c6-7, c7-t1 and inferiorly t2-3 disc degenerative changes are seen. disc bulging is seen at c6-7 level. there is slightly increased signal with atrophy seen in the spinal cord at c3-4 level. this finding appears to be chronic. no other areas of increased signal seen within the spinal cord.
from t12-l1 to l3-l4, degenerative disease are seen as did previously. mild spinal stenosis is noted at l3-l4 level as before. at l4-l5, the patient has undergone right-sided hemilaminectomy. soft tissue changes are seen surrounding the thecal sac on the right side and along the laminectomy. following gadolinium, enhancement is seen within the soft tissues. given the immediate postoperative change with the surgery being performed the day before the examination, there is some limitation of evaluation with the soft tissue changes, but no evidence of a large residual or recurrent disc herniation is identified. the thecal sac compression appears to have decreased compared to the prior study, but also it has remained mildly compressed. note is made of enhancement of several of the nerve roots within the cauda equina following gadolinium administration. this finding indicates inflammation of the cauda equina nerve roots. at l5-s1 level, mild degenerative disc disease and bulging is seen with facet degenerative changes without spinal stenosis.
there is a large area of signal abnormality and abnormal enhancement centered around the left portion of the t7 vertebral body and extending into the posterior elements on the left side, posteromedial rib articulating with the vertebral body, and epidurally, with resultant complete obliteration of the subarachnoid space and compression of the spinal cord. the signal within the spinal cord at this level or any other levels is within normal limits. the height of the t7 vertebral body is diminished by at least 25%. this constellation of finding is consistent with osseous metastasis and epidural extension. similar bone marrow signal abnormalities are visualized in the vertebral bodies of c7, t5, t6, t8, t9, and t12. mild central compression deformity is present at c7 vertebral body. these findings are consistent with additional osseous metastases. the alignment throughout cervical and thoracic spine is anatomic. the craniocervical junction is within normal limits. with respect to degenerative changes, there is broad-based disc/osteophyte complex with a superimposed right paracentral disc herniation at the level of c3/4, which results in obliteration of the ventral subarachnoid space and mass effect upon the spinal cord. broad-based disc/osteophyte complex with similar imaging characteristics is seen at c5/6 level. the previously mentioned osseous metastasis at c7 level indents the right anterior aspect of the thecal sac, but does not come in contact with the spinal cord. there is also extension of this osseous metastasis into the right c7/t1 neural foramen. no significant degenerative change is seen of the thoracic spine.
there is straightening of the usual lordotic curve. the type iii fracture of the dens is visualized to some extent. the superior extension to the atlantoaxial joint is better seen on the right than the left. comparison is made to the ct of the same day. there is no change in alignment compared to the prior study. there is no significant stenosis of the canal, and no epidural hematoma is seen. superiorly the spinal cord is normal in signal intensity. further inferiorly the artifact projects over it on the stir images without an abnormality seen on the t2-weighted images. the other levels are normal. the vertebral artery flow voids are normal. as is typically the case, the left vertebral artery is larger than the right. a mra was subsequently performed.

the examination is limited by motion. again, a small area of increased signal is identified at c2 level within the posterior aspect of the spinal cord. no distinct enhancement is seen in this region. these findings are suspicious for demyelinating process. correlation with brain mri examination recommended. mild degenerative disc disease is seen in the cervical region as before. no evidence of other abnormal areas of intraspinal enhancement is seen. no spinal cord compression noted.
the vertebral bodies are of normal height. there is normal signal intensity of the bone marrow. the disc spaces as well as the signal in the discs are preserved. the alignment of the spinal cord is anatomic. of note, there is mild atrophy and fatty replacement of the left psoas muscle and, to a lesser extent, paraspinal muscles which may be related to disuse or local spinal nerve root impingement. the abnormalities by level will be described below: at the level of l3/l4, there is mild disc bulge with no spinal canal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing. at the level of l4/l5, there is also mild-to-moderate disc bulge which is slightly asymmetric to the right side. there is mild narrowing of the subarticular recess on the right side without compression of the nerve root. at the level of l5/s1, no significant abnormalities detected.

the bone marrow is diffusely heterogeneous consistent with diffuse osseous metastases from patient's known metastatic breast carcinoma. these are present throughout all of the visualized skeleton. however, the central canal is patent with no abnormal signal within the cord. the craniocervical junction is unremarkable. at c5-6, there is a posterior osteophyte with some uncovertebral degenerative changes. this results in moderate left and mild right neural foraminal narrowing. at c6-7, there is a posterior osteophyte. there is no significant neural foraminal narrowing.
there is an epidural fluid collection identified extending from l2-3 superiorly to the thoracic region with the superior extent not identified. the maximum width of this collection is approximately 1 cm in the anterior-posterior dimension. there is indentation on the thecal sac and there is enhancement of the marginal meninges indicative of an epidural abscess. additionally, there is fluid collection seen from l4-5 inferiorly along the right facet joint with enhancement at the margins measuring approximately 7 mm, indicative of an epidural abscess. there is fluid and enhancement seen surrounding the right facet joints at l3-4 and l4-5 levels suggestive of septic arthritis. additionally, there is a fluid collection seen within the soft tissues, starting at l5 level extending superiorly to l2 level within the erector spinae muscle and has multiloculated appearance with a maximum dimension of 4 cm at l5 level with the superior inferior extent of approximately 9 cm. this finding indicates a soft tissue abscess. subtle increased signal is seen within the l4-5 disc without definite enhancement. this could represent early discitis. the distal spinal cord shows normal signal intensities. no evidence of psoas abscess seen.

there is evidence of degenerative disc disease with spinal canal stenosis at l3-4, l1-2 level and l4-5 level. degenerative changes are also noted in the vertebral bodies. there is linear enhancing tissue noted in the epidural region at t12-l2 level, likely due to epidural abscess. however, the upper extent of this is not visualized on the l-spine mri. cord compression cannot be adequately assessed. no pre- or para-vertebral soft tissue abnormality.
anterior compression deformities are seen of the l1 and l2 vertebral bodies with increased t2 and stir signal intensity and decreased t1 signal intensity along the superior endplates. there is normal vertebral body alignment. there are no retropulsed fragments or canal stenosis as a result of the fractures. disc space height is normal. mild disc desiccation is seen at l3-4 and l5-s1. the conus terminates at the l1 level and is normal in appearance. increased stir signal is seen within the paraspinal musculature posterior to the l1 through l3 vertebral bodies consistent with soft tissue edema.
no comparisons are available. the conus medullaris normally ends at the level of t12/l1. the visualized bone marrow signal is normal. at l2/3, there is a mildly desiccated, as well as mild disc bulge and slight bilateral facet joint degeneration, shortened pedicles, with resultant minimal central canal and mild bilateral neural foraminal stenosis. there is a tiny posterior anular tear. at l3/4, there is a moderate, broad-based disc bulge, shortened pedicles and degenerative changes of the facet joints causing moderately severe central stenosis, moderate right neural foraminal and mild left neural foraminal stenosis. the disc is moderately narrowed and desiccated. at l4/5, there a moderately bulging disc, as well as a superimposed moderate right sided disc herniation. in conjunction with prominent bilateral facet joint degeneration and shortened pedicles, there is prominent central canal, severe right l5 lateral recess, as well as mild bilateral neural foramninal stenosis. the disc is moderately narrowed and desiccated. at l5/s1, a tiny synovial/subchondral cyst is seen in the left s1 superior articular facet region. the disc is mildly desiccated.
image quality is markedly degraded due to the orientation of the phase encoding gradients in the anteroposterior dimension. this renders the axial images, close to uninterpretable. on sagittal t2-weighted images, posterior spondylytic ridges are seen at c3-4, ___, ___, and ___ levels with impression upon the ventral aspect of the spinal cord flattening of the ventral aspect of the thecal sac. adequate csf signal is seen posterior to the cord at these levels. proliferative changes of the ligamentum flavum is seen at c4-5 and c5-6. there is no evidence of cord edema, but again the motion artifacts result in very low quality images. no increased signal intensity is seen within the osseous structures or discs on stir or t2- weighted images.
the images are slightly degraded from phase-encode artifact which precludes complete assessment of the cord. in the sagittal projection, the c1 through upper portion of t4 vertebral bodies are visualized. there is normal vertebral body height and alignment with preservation of disc space height. normal vertebral body and disc signal intensity is seen. at the c3-4 level, there is mild disc protrusion with mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. at the c4-5 level, there is a minor disc osteophyte complex with resultant mild narrowing of the right and left neural foramina. at c5-6, there is a more prominent disc osteophyte complex on the right resulting in moderate spinal stenosis and moderate narrowing of the right neural foramen. the osteophyte complex also is seen to indent upon the right ventral cord. no increased stir or t2 signal intensity is seen in the cord. prevertebral soft tissue signal intensity is normal. there may be a tiny thyroid nodule seen within the right lobe of the thyroid.
there is diffusely decreased t1 and t2 signal in the vertebrae, as previously described. the nature of this finding is uncertain. this may be related to the patient's hematopoietic condition and should be correlated with clinical history. vertebral alignment is maintained. the appearance of the intervertebral spaces is unchanged. there is no evidence of impingement on the thecal sac. the conus is in normal position and it has a normal appearance.
there is no change in appearance of vertebral body and intervertebral disc changes at l4-5 with post-contrast enhancement consistent with osteomyelitis and discitis. no further destruction of the endplates is seen. there is no new epidural abscess or paraspinal collection. degenerative changes seen on prior examinations are unchanged. nerve root diverticula seen at nearly all levels from t11-12 through s1-2 are again identified.
comparison is made to outside mr ___ ___ dated ___. there has been no significant change since the prior study. there is destruction of the l4/5 disc as well as the inferior endplate of l4 and the superior endplate of l5. there is diffuse enhancement of the vertebral bodies of l4 and l5 as well as diffuse enhancement of the surrounding paraspinal soft tissues extending into the psoas muscles bilaterally. there is also extension of soft tissue enhancement into the epidural space at the l4/5 level. this is causing moderate compression of the thecal sac. these findings are consistent with discitis, osteomyelitis, with paraspinal and epidural phlegmon, the latter causing moderate thecal sac compression. no discrete fluid collections identifying an abscess cavity are seen. the involved vertebrae and disc are t2 hyperintense, consistent with inflammatory edema. the conus medullaris normally ends at the level of l1 and no signal abnormalities of the visualized spinal cord are seen.

there are no compression fractures. the t12/l1 level remains normal. there is progression of the degenerative disc disease changes at l1/2 compared to ___. there is now a disc bulge with endplate degenerative changes and disc space narrowing but no stenosis or focal nerve root compression. at l2/3, there is a left lateral disc herniation, in retrospect probably present previously. it might affect the left l2 nerve root, without change. the l3/4 level is normal. at l4/5, the disc is narrowed and there is a disc bulge with small disc space osteophytes. there is facet and ligamentous hypertrophy without significant spinal stenosis. these abnormalities have progressed somewhat since ___. there remains mild left foraminal stenosis. at l5/s1, the disc is narrowed and there is a disc bulge with small facet and disc space osteophytes. the canal and foramina are well maintained. the conus medullaris is best visualized on the sagittal t2-weighted images, at the l1 level. no abnormal cauda equina enhancement is seen.
there are no enhancing abnormalities. the conus terminates normally at l1-2. there is no significant disc disease, epidural hematoma or abscess. the vertebral body marrow signal and alignment is normal. there is minimal soft tissue edema within the posterior paraspinal soft tissues consistent with the prior lumbar puncture.
as seen on the ct examination of the preceding day, there is considerable prevertebral soft tissue swelling particularly superiorly. there is an underlying c2 fracture with a horizontally oriented fracture line across the base of the dens which extends inferiorly at the posterior c2 body, most consistent with type iii fracture. as expected fluid signal intensity is seen in that fracture. no significant epidural fluid collection is seen and there is no spinal cord compression or abnormal signal intensity in the spinal cord at that level. the abnormalities in the region of the anterior arch of c1 are poorly visualized. there is also edema associated with the fracture through the tip of the c4 spinous process, consistent with acute fracture. there is some increased signal intensity in the c6/7 disc, on the stir images and the avulsion fracture from the anterior inferior endplate of c6 is to some extent visualized. no clear abnormal signal intensity is seen in the spinal cord nor is there any epidural hematoma. the foramina are grossly well maintained and on the t2-weighted images, normal low-signal intensity is seen in both vertebral arteries.
compression of the superior end plate of t12 is identified which displays bright marrow signal on stir imaging implying a new compression fracture of the superior end plate of t12. no abnormal enhancement within the vertebral body is noted to suggest metastatic involvement. the remaining regions of the spine display no disc, vertebral, or paraspinal pathology. there is no spinal stenosis or spondylolisthesis. there is no abnormal enhancement involving the spine and no evidence of epidural abscess. the visualized distal spinal cord, conus medullaris, and cauda equina are unremarkable. abnormally enlarged retroperitoneal nodes are again identified, previously noted on ct torso ___.
there has been no significant interval change. again a diffuse infiltrative process is seen in the l3 vertebral body with compression and retropulsion and high-grade thecal sac compression. there is intraspinal mass identified in the anterior epidural space with left paraspinal mass. following gadolinium, enhancement of the soft tissues is seen which demonstrate that the thecal sac compression is predominantly secondary to epidural soft tissue disease. overall the thecal sac compression and the paraspinal mass have remained unchanged in size. there are no new areas of signal abnormalities seen in the visualized vertebral bodies. mild multilevel degenerative changes are identified. the distal spinal cord shows normal signal intensities.
again is noted the mass within the body of the l3 lumbar vertebra extending into the epidural space and involving the pedicle on the left side. a paravertebral mass on the left is again identified. there is severe canal stenosis, which is unchanged from the previous examination. there are no definite changes from the previous examination. there is no definite evidence of involvement of additional vertebra.
there is mildly exaggerated lordosis of the cervical spine with associated exaggerated kyphosis of the mid thoracic spine. there is mild central canal stenosis at c4-c5 and c5-c6 related to mild thickening of the ligamentum flavum. however, the signal intensity values of the cord are unremarkable and there is no cord compression. there are no signal abnormalities in the soft tissues to suggest ligamentous injury. a small focus of hyperintensity on both t1- and t2-weighted imaging and c4 may represent a hemangioma. patchy fatty infiltration is visualized among other cervical vertebral bodies. the alignment of the thoracic spine is also preserved without listhesis. the signal intensity values of the thoracic cord are normal. patchy fatty infiltration is noted among thoracic vertebral bodies. foci of hyperintensity on t1- weighted imaging in t7 and t10 probably represent hemangiomas or additional foci of fatty infiltration. there is a mild anterior wedge compression fracture of t12, which shows, however, no abnormal signal intensity characteristics to suggest that it is recent. at t11-t12, there is a mild paracentral disc protrusion, with mild canal stenosis, without cord compression. partial fusion of l1 and l2 is noted, probably degenerative in etiology. there is a 3.8-cm diameter cyst along the right renal cortex. additional subcentimeter t2 intense foci in the left kidney probably represent parapelvic renal cysts. there are also at least two t2 hyperintense lesions in the thyroid, which are not well characterized here.
comparison is made to a ct of the lumbar spine from ___ as well as mr of the lumbar spine from ___. the anterior spinal artery is not definitively visualized. again seen is an enhancing lesion involving the l1 vertebral body with compression fracture of the l1 vertebral body. also noted is epidural extension and paraspinal extension of this enhancing mass, consistent with metastasis. there is high-grade stenosis of the spinal canal at that level, as previously seen. also seen is a large heterogeneous enhancing mass involving the left kidney, consistent with the known renal cell carcinoma. neovascularity around the left paraspinal tumor is seen.
the bone marrow signal intensity is normal without evidence of metastatic disease. at l3/4 and l4/5, the discs are desiccated and bulge minimally. at l5/s1, there is a small left paramedian disc protrusion. there is also some protrusion of disc material in the right foramen. there are facet osteophytes and there is moderate stenosis of both foramina. the conus medullaris is seen at the l1 level and appears normal. there is a minute fibrolipoma of the filum terminale. no abnormal nerve root enhancement is seen.
there is normal alignment of the cervical vertebral bodies. preservation of height of the vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs is seen. normal vertebral body and disc signal intensity is present. at c2-3, and c3-4, there are no disc herniations, evidence of spinal stenosis, or neural foraminal narrowing. at c4-5, there is a small central osteophyte without spinal stenosis or neuroforaminal narrowing. at c5-6, a right disc protrusion touches the ventral aspect of the spinal cord resulting in spinal stenosis. additionally, there is narrowing of the right neural foramen, but no impingement upon the exiting c6 nerve root sleeve. at c6-7 and c7-t1, no disc herniations, spinal stenosis, or neuroforaminal narrowing is present. signal intensity within the spinal cord and cervical medullary junction is normal. there is no signal abnormality within the paraspinal or prevertebral soft tissue. within both thyroid lobes, several rounded areas of t2 signal hypointensity are demonstrated, consistent with small nodules. additionally, the thyroid gland is diffusely enlarged.
compared to the prior study, there appears to be increased fluid in the l1-2 disc space, persistent epidural abscess causing compression upon the thecal sac and its contents. increased t2 signal intensity with areas of enhancement is noted at the laminectomy site. bilateral psoas abscesses are noted, right more than left, with some increased areas of probable necrosis or fluid content on the right side, compared to before. persistent enhancement of the nerve roots in the thecal sac is noted, consistent with arachnoiditis.
there is mild endplate depression at l2 without marrow abnormalities to suggest an acute fracture. areas of focal fat deposition and endplate degenerative changes are seen. no abnormalities are seen that suggest lumbar spine osteomyelitis. there are degenerative disc disease changes. at t11/12, there is a disc bulge. there is some retrolisthesis at l2/3 with a central disc protrusion, but no significant spinal stenosis. at l4/5, there is mild spinal stenosis from posterior element hypertrophy. mild bony stenosis of the right foramen is noted. the conus medullaris is seen at the l1 level. the cauda equina appears normal. note is made that the visualized muscles are atrophied and there is fatty replacement of them. there is edema in the subcutaneous fat dorsally, findings associated with bed rest. presacral and superficial sacral soft tissue edema are visualized at the edge of the field of view, more completely evaluated on the pelvic mri.
there is a comminuted fracture of the c2 vertebral body involving the right pedicle as well, with associated hematoma centrally within the vertebral body and extending anteriorly into the prevertebral soft tissues, where considerable edema is also present. bony detail is better discerned however on the recent cervical spine ct. fluid within the prevertebral soft tissues and within the nuchal ligaments adjacent to the occiput suggest ligamentous injury. there is a relatively thin anterior epidural hematoma tracking inferiorly from the site of the fracture,extending from the mid portion of c2 to the c5-c6 interspace. it measures up to 3 mm in thickness anteriorly. however, at the level of the fracture along the mid body of c2, there is also an epidural hematoma along the right posterolateral aspect of the canal with mild impression on the thecal sac. at the level of the fracture, the cord shows patchy t2- hyperintensity, but no hematoma or contour abnormality. this appearance raises concern for injury to the cord. however, if anything, the alignment of the cervical spine appears slightly improved since the recent study, and there is cerebrospinal fluid surrounding the entire cord suggesting that at present, it is not compressed. there is mild cervical spondylosis with osteophytes at c5-c6, including intervertebral disc space narrowing and slight canal stenosis due to posterior osteophytes. in the thoracic spine, there is fluid in the t6-t7 interspace, corresponding to injury to the intervertebral disc, with slight anterior vertebral body height loss of t7. this appearance corresponds to the wedge compression fracture seen on the recent ct. there is also similar slight anterior distraction at the t6-t7 interspace. in addition, these images show a horizontal band of edema through the l2 intervertebral body, which shows a normal contour. the overall appearance is suspicious for a nondisplaced fracture of l2. the thoracic cord and conus, which terminates at t12, appears normal and without cord compression or edema. there is no evidence of epidural hematoma within the thoracic spine. there is a chest tube in the left hemithorax. there is residual left-sided pleural fluid and probably atelectasis. very limited views of the surrounding soft tissues are otherwise unremarkable.
the alignment of the lumbar spine is preserved, without listhesis. the conus ends at the level of the t12-l1 interspace. at l2-l3, there is a mild disc bulge without significant impingement on the central spinal canal or neural foramina. at l3-l4, there is intervertebral disc space narrowing with posterior and anterior osteophytes, including mild lateral recess and neural foraminal narrowing on the left. there is also left-sided thickening of the ligamentum flavum, with mild posterolateal impression of the thecal sac. at l4-l5, there is a broad- based posterior disc bulge, which is somewhat greater on the left than right, with mild impression on the thecal sac and mild-to- moderate neural foraminal narrowing on the left side. there is mild disc desiccation at l5-s1 without significant canal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing. axial images do not cover the area of t11 where the presence of fluid is questioned on the accompanying thoracic spine study. there is minimal prominence of the infrarenal aorta, which measures 2.7 cm in diameter. there is a slightly increased signal intensity on t2-weighted imaging in the presacral space, which could represent edema or fluid. this region is only minimally encompassed on the available sagittal images.
there is congenital narrowing of the lumbar spinal canal visualized. from t11-12 to l2-3, disc degenerative changes are identified. at l2-3, mild disc bulging and thickening of the ligaments result in mild spinal stenosis. at l3-4, disc and facet degenerative changes are identified with thickening of the ligaments resulting in severe spinal stenosis. there is mild bilateral foraminal narrowing seen. at l4-5, disc and facet degenerative changes are identified with thickening of the ligaments resulting in moderate spinal stenosis. in addition, there is a disc protrusion in the right foramen resulting in severe narrowing of the foramen which could result in compression of the exiting right l4 nerve root. at l5-s1 level, disc and facet degenerative changes are identified without spinal stenosis. the distal spinal cord shows normal signal intensities.
the overall alignment of the cervical spine is preserved without listhesis. the fractures through the right c4 vertebral artery foramen are not well demonstrated on this study, probably because they are minimally displaced and motion artifact limits evaluation of the axial imaging on this study. there are no signal abnormalities within the cord. there is, however, mild central canal stenosis at c3-4 associated with a moderate right paracentral disc herniation, without cord edema. there is mild spinal cord deformity at this point, also due to congenital pedicular shortening. a small posterior disc protrusion is seen at c5/6, without cord compression. the thoracic spine was also scanned, which is unremarkable, without alignment abnormality, fracture, or signal abnormalities. along the right aspect of the spine, at the t11 level, there is bright signal intensity on sagittal t2- weighted imaging, which is poorly characterized here. this could represent fluid within the abdomen or artifact. correlation with clinical factors is recommended. consideration could be given to imaging of the abdomen to clarify this observation.
the lumbar vertebral bodies are diffusely diminished in t1 signal intensity, consistent with the known metastases and status post radiation. heterogeneous contrast enhancement of the vertebral bodies reflect the presence of metastatic disease, as well. at l3-4 level, there is minimal disc bulge causing flattening of the thecal sac. at the level of the inferior portion of the l4, there is a small area of tissue intensity material in the anterior epidural space, on the left side causing mild indentation on the left side of the thecal sac with no contrast enhancement. this finding ould represent either a small extension of the tumor into the epidural region versus an extruded disc (series 7, image 95). the latter diagnosis is potentially more plausible, given the lack of apparent contrast enhancement of the finding. at l4-l5 level, minimal disc bulge is noted. at l5-s1 level, there is a small right disc protrusion, displacing the right s1 root sleeve slightly posteriorly. areas of altered signal intensity are noted in both iliac bones, with large area soft tissue mass in the left side of the pelvis anterior to the iliac bone, which is incompletely evaluated on the present study. the cord ends at t12-l1 level and there is no evidence of cord compression on the images included in the present study.
there are no areas of abnormal enhancement. foci of hyperintensity on t2-weighted imaging within the medulla, the proximal upper cervical cord, and the distal cervical cord remain present, but are considerably improved, and the lesions are no longer expansile in character, as observed previously. in the thoracic spine, there are areas of t2 signal abnormality, also without mass effect or enhancement. as axial imaging was not performed in the thoracic spine previously, direct comparison is limited, but there are no definite new lesions. the osseous structures are unremarkable. surrounding soft tissue structures appear normal.
this examination is severely limited by motion. there is evidence of laminectomy in the lower lumbar region. there is generalized disc bulging at multiple levels. there is first-degree spondylolisthesis at l4-5 and l5- s1. on the stir sequence, there is some question of increased signal within the disc space, but there is some motion artifact. there is no evidence of abnormal contrast enhancement at this level. there does also appear to be some increased signal within the adjacent vertebra. high-grade canal stenosis is not identified.
this study, dated ___, is available for interpretation on ___. there are no comparison mr examinations on record, and comparison is made with the most recent whole-body bone scan, dated ___. there is uniform dark signal throughout the c7 vertebral body, likely representing known sclerotic metastatis. there is no associated stir-hyperintensity, paravertebral soft tissue mass, or pathologic enhancement. there is no evidence of spinal canal or cord compromise at this level. no lesion is seen in the imaged portion of the skull base or remainder of the cervical spine. it is not clear whether this corresponds to the focus of increased activity in the cervical spine, demonstrated on the recent radionuclide bone scan, as this focus appears located more at the right lateral aspect of the more mid- cervical spine. there is multilevel spondylosis throughout the cervical spine with disc endplate osteophyte complexes at the c4-5 through c6-7 levels, which efface the ventral csf and flatten that aspect of the spinal cord. however, there is abundant posterior csf space with no overall cord deformity or abnormality of intrinsic signal. also noted is right more than left uncovertebral degenerative change at the c5-6 level with resultant moderate right neural foraminal narrowing. there is no pathologic focus of leptomeningeal, epidural or paraspinal enhancement in the cervical spine. incidentally noted is extensive fluid within the right more than left mastoid air cells. dark-signal foci are also identified in the anterior t5, virtually the entire t8 and the dorsal l2 vertebrae. stir hyperintensity is identified at the posterior aspect of t8, with equivocal enhancement involving the dorsal- inferior quarter of this vertebral body, which may represent a mixed sclerotic-lytic, partially treated or recurrent metastatic lesion. however, though the axial post-contrast sequences is degraded by motion artifact, there is no definite enhancing epidural or paraspinal soft tissue mass and no canal or spinal cord compromise at this level. there is no stir signal or enhancing abnormality associated with the t5 and l2 sclerotic foci, with a probable incidental hemangioma in the anterior aspect of t6. the thoracic spinal cord is normal in caliber and intrinsic signal throughout, and the conus medullaris is normal in morphology and terminates at the l1-2 level. small central disc herniations are identified at the t6-7 through t8-9 and t10-11 through l1-2 levels, but these do not significantly narrow the spinal canal. no pathologic focus of leptomeningeal, epidural, or paraspinal enhancement is identified in the thoracic spine.
there is evidence of increased signal seen within the c4, c5, and c6 vertebral bodies. in addition, increased signal is seen on inversion recovery and t2 images within the c4-5 and c5-6 discs. following gadolinium, enhancement is seen in the epidural soft tissues with an area of which does not enhance, extending on the posterior margin of c4 and c5 vertebral bodies indicative of an epidural abscess. in addition, there is also a fluid collection indicative of epidural abscess seen in the prevertebral region extending from c4 to c6. the prevertebral soft tissue thickness is also prominent indicating inflammatory changes extending from c3 to c7. these findings indicate reaccumulation of the epidural abscess with a new prevertebral abscess. in addition, compared to the prior study, the signal changes within the intervertebral disc and enhancement have also increased. in addition, there is moderate- to-severe compression of the spinal cord seen at c4 and c5 level with increased signal within the spinal cord. this finding is more prominent since the previous study of ___. a small fluid collection at the anterolateral right nect could be post-operative fluid collection.
t12 vertebral body demonstrates severe compression with retropulsion narrowing the spinal canal. there is 50% narrowing of the spinal canal with indentation on the spinal cord. there is subtle increased signal seen within the spinal cord. the compressed vertebral body demonstrates low signal on t1-weighted images with area of low and central high signal on inversion recovery and t2 images. there are no other foci of focal signal abnormalities seen within the visualized bony structures. mild multilevel degenerative changes are identified with disc bulging from l2-3 to l5-s1 levels. there is no spinal stenosis or high-grade foraminal narrowing seen. bilateral small contracted kidneys are noted.
the previously noted ct of the cervical spine demonstrated no fractures. today's examination demonstrates no bone marrow edema. there is focal fatty infiltration in the endplates around the c6-7 disc space with degenerative disc disease. there is also c6-7 disc desiccation and disc space narrowing with both anterior and posterior osteophytes. there is no significant spinal canal stenosis. the spinal cord is normal through all levels with no abnormal signal. there does not appear to be any disc herniations on limited sequences provided. incidental note is made of mucosal thickening and fluid and edema in the sphenoid sinus which should be correlated clinically.
the cervical vertebral bodies are unremarkable, limited in evaluation due to low signal noise ratio anteriorly. difficult correlation between the axial and the sagittal images. possible small disc protrusions at c3-4, c4-5, c5-6 causing mild indentation on the thecal sac. there is also possible ligamentum flavum thickening at these regions. at c6-c7 level, there is a broad-based disc protrusion and bilateral paracentral regions, of no consequence. there is no evidence of cord compression. however, there is increased signal noted within the spinal cord suggestive of syrinx at c7 level. the pre and paravertebral soft tissues are unremarkable. the cerebellar tonsils are normal in position.
there has been no significant interval change in the appearance of the cervical spine from the prior exam. the alignment of the cervical vertebral bodies is normal. normal signal is demonstrated within the marrow. the spinal cord and cervicomedullary junction demonstrate normal signal. no paraspinal signal abnormality is demonstrated. at c2/3, no significant disc abnormality is detected. the neural foramen are normal. at c3/4, there is a tiny central disc herniation. mild bilateral narrowing of the neural foramen is likely related to small osteophytes. at c4/5, there is a small central disc herniation, no spinal stenosis, or neural foraminal stenosis is detected. at c5/6, prominent bilateral foraminal narrowing is secondary to uncovertebral degenerative changes. at c6/7, moderate narrowing of the neural foramen bilaterally is likely secondary to uncovertebral degenerative changes. disc herniation or spinal stenosis is present.
there is maintenance of the normal lumbar spine lordosis without listhesis. vertebral body heights are maintained. intervertebral disc spaces are preserved. normal disc signal is seen at every level. the conus terminates at t12-l1. no intrinsic cord signal abnormality is seen. no abnormal edema is noted in the posterior paraspinal soft tissues. at l4-5, there is a minimal concentric disc bulge. mild bilateral facet joint hypertrophy is seen. no central canal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing is seen. at l5-s1, there is a mild concentric disc bulge and mild bilateral facet joint hypertrophy. no central canal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing is seen.
there is a small eccentric to the right disc herniation at the level of c3-4, which indents the thecal sac anteriorly but does not cause significant central canal narrowing. neural foramina are widely patent at this level. the remainder of the cervical levels are unremarkable with preservation of the vertebral body heights, alignment, and intervertebral disc spaces. no abnormal signal is noted in the cord. the known fracture is not well visualized on this study.
the t11 and t12 vertebral bodies demonstrate compression of the superior endplates. mild compression is seen at the superior endplate of t11 and moderate compression is seen at the superior endplate of t12. there is no evidence of significant retropulsion seen. the areas of compression demonstrate increased signal on inversion recovery images indicative of acute/subacute compressions. there is no evidence of spinal stenosis or disc herniation seen at this level. from l2-3 to l5-s1 level, degenerative disc disease is identified with mild bulging. at l4-5, small central disc protrusion is seen slightly indenting the thecal sac. the distal spinal cord shows normal signal intensities. the evaluation of paraspinal soft tissues demonstrates a transplant kidney on the right side in the right iliac region.
the vertebral alignment is preserved. there is no disc, vertebral, or paraspinal pathology seen, with the exception of small amount of prevertebral fluid in the absence of direct evidence of anterior longitudinal ligamentous injury. there is no spinal stenosis. visualized spinal cord, foramen magnum and its contents are unremarkable.
there is a anterior compression fracture with a soft tissue mass within the t3 vertebral body, most predominantly throughout the left side involving the left pedicle and transverse process. this appears to extend into the neural foramen. there is also epidural soft tissue present, displacing the cord slightly to the left. however, there is no evidence of cord compression at this time with no evidence of abnormal signal within the cord at this level. there is increased signal on stir sequence within this vertebral body. these findings are most consistent with a pathologic compression fracture due to a neoplastic process, likely relating to the patient's myeloma. in addition, there is low t1 signal throughout the bone marrow due to red marrow reactivation or marrow replacement. no additional compression fractures or spinal canal stenoses are identified. evaluation of the lumbar spine is limited due to patient motion artifact. however again, the bone marrow signal is low in t1, consistent with either red marrow reactivation or a marrow replacing process. there is mild compression of the l2 vertebral body. there appears to be some mildly increased t2 signal within this vertebral body on the stir sequence, consistent with mild edema. this is likely due to infiltration of the vertebral body due to multiple myeloma, with a mild underlying pathologic compression fracture. there is no significant spinal canal stenosis with no significant retropulsion of bony fragments. the alignment of the lumbar spine is normal. the deformity of the l1 vertebral body does not have any associated bone marrow edema, consistent with chronic compression fracture.
a small right-sided disc herniation is again identified at c3-4 which again appears to indent the thecal sac anteriorly, but does not cause significant spinal cord canal narrowing. again, the neural foramen at this level appear widely patent. additionally, at c6-7, there is an acentric leftward disc herniation causing moderate stenosis of the left neural foramen. the remainder of the cervical levels are unremarkable and no abnormal alignment is identified. although the known fracture of the c2 transverse process is not well visualized, the vertebral artery signals at that level are normal.
patient is status post laminectomy from l3-s1 levels. the conus terminates normally at the l1 vertebra. there is some straightening of the normal lordosis. at the l1-2 level, there is mild generalized disc bulge without evidence of conus impingement. at the l2-3 level, there is grade 1 retrolisthesis of l2 on 3 with uncovering of the disc. at the l3-4 level, there is mild grade 1 anterolisthesis of l3 on 4 with disc uncovering. there is no evidence of canal stenosis. mild foraminal narrowing is noted bilaterally. at the l4-5 level, there is a mild generalized disc bulge without evidence of high-grade central canal stenosis. mild left and right foraminal stenosis noted. at the l5-s1 level, there is unchanged narrowing of the transverse spinal canal diameter.
no prior lumbar spine studies are available. the l1/2, l2/3 and l3/4 levels were unremarkable. at l4/5, there is mild spondylolisthesis. there is a disc bulge. there is marked posterior element hypertrophy and severe spinal stenosis. the foramina are mildly to moderately stenotic. at l5/s1, there appear to have been laminectomies and possibly a lateral fusion. there is considerable enhancing epidural scar, worse on the left than the right. the foramina are widely patent. the conus medullaris ends at the l1 level and is grossly normal. there is no diffuse enhancement of the cauda equina.
the previously noted mass at the anterior epidural space at l4 and l5 level does not demonstrate enhancement. there is enhancement at the superior aspect which appears to be secondary to venous enhancement. the mass appears to be extending bilaterally into the neural foramina but no enhancement is seen. there are no paraspinal abnormalities seen.
no comparison examinations are available. the craniocervical junction is normal. the bone marrow signal and cervical spine alignment is normal. at c2-3, there is a small central disc herniation contacting the ventral surface of the cord. there is no neural foraminal narrowing. at c3-4, there is a minute central disc protrusion indenting the ventral thecal sac. there is no significant neural foraminal narrowing. at c4-5, there is a very large posterior osteophyte which deforms the spinal cord and causes severe spinal canal narrowing. in combination with bilateral facet and uncovertebral osteophytes, there is at least moderate bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. there appears to be some mild increased signal within the cord at this level, consistent with myelomalacia due to spinal canal stenosis. at c5-6, there is a small central posterior osteophyte which indents the ventral surface of the cord. there is mild spinal canal stenosis at this level. at c6-7, there is no significant disc herniation or neural foraminal narrowing.
no pre-gadolinium images are obtained. therefore, contrast enhancement cannot be accurately commented upon. the study is correlated with prior from ___, where the pre-contrast images were obtained. there is no evidence of abnormal enhancement of the nerve roots. no masses are identified. there are no epidural collections. the neural foramina are patent.
as seen on the previous study, there is an epidural mass identified extending from l3-4 to l5-s1 level within the anterior epidural space with high-grade compression of the thecal sac and cauda equina. the mass also extends to both neural foramina at l4-5 level. no paraspinal mass is identified. there is no evidence of abnormal signal seen within the vertebral bodies or discs in the lumbar region. the distal spinal cord shows normal signal intensities.
the visualized spinal cord demonstrates no signal abnormalities. no abnormalities are detected at the craniocervical junction on the sagittal images. the visualized portions of the transverse ligament appear within normal limits on the sagittal images, though this region is not included on the axial images. there are no areas of stir signal abnormality. the prevertebral soft tissues are within normal limits. the previously identified malalignment at c1-2 is not as well assessed on this study. the alignment is otherwise unremarkable. the spinal canal is widely patent. the vertebral body heights and disc spaces are preserved. normal marrow signal is identified.
there is no signal abnormality within the vertebral bodies or the intervertebral discs to suggest discitis/osteomyelitis. there is no signal abnormality within the cervical ___ cord. the ___ canal is grossly patent, without evidence of epidural hematoma, phlegmon, or frank abscess. within the paraspinal soft tissues, susceptibility artifact from the orthopedic hardware is seen within the lower cervical spine, limiting the evaluation. there is notable enhancement in the posterior paraspinal soft tissues, likely post-surgical in nature. in the superficial posterior soft tissues, slightly to the left of midline, extending from the level of c2/c3 disc to the level of c5 vertebral body, there is approximately 3.6 x 0.7 cm fluid collection, with an enhancing rim, which may represent a postoperative sterile fluid collection or an abscess.
visualization of the thoracic spine is significantly limited by the susceptibility artifact created by the orthopedic hardware. with this limitation in mind, there is no gross signal abnormality within the vertebral bodies or the intervertebral discs to suggest discitis/osteomyelitis in the thoracic or lumbar spine. a small amount of high t2 signal at the periphery of the bone cage may be postoperative edema, although complete exclusion of an underlying inflammatory process is not possible via imaging. within the ___ canal, at the level of t2/t3 disc, to the right of the thecal sac, there is an irregularly shaped approximately 1.5 x 0.8 cm heterogeneously enhancing and heterogeneous, predominantly high t2 and low t1 signal focus, of unknown clinical significance, which may represent a postoperative scar or, potentially, an epidural phlegmon. in addition, in the posterior epidural space at the t2 level, there is a 2.8 x 0.6 cm high signal collection with an enhancing rim, which, once again, may be a postoperative seroma or phlegmon.. finally, in the posterior superficial paraspinal soft tissues, slightly to the left of midline, there is a 5.5 x 1.8 cm fluid collection with enhancing rim, which may also represent a postoperative seroma versus an abscess. visualization of the ___ canal at mid thoracic level is significantly limited by the susceptibility artifact from the extensive metallic hardware. below t7 level, however, the canal is patent. there is high t2 signal lesion within the right iliac bone, consistent with a recent iliac crest bone graft.

a prominent csf space can be seen within the posterior fossa. t2- weighted and stir images demonstrate a thin strip of high signal intensity along the anterior aspect of the cervical spine, beginning at the c4-c5 vertebral body and extending inferiorly. this high signal, likely edema, begins near the widened c4-c5 intervertebral space described on the prior ct cervical spine exam. there are posteriorly located osteophytes at the c4/5 and the c5/6 intervertebral levels. these osteophytes do not significantly impinge upon the spinal cord, and there is no significant spinal stenosis. there is no evidence of spinal cord contusion by this examination. t2-weighted images demonstrate a right, large pleural effusion.
the c1 fracture is much better appreciated on the cervical spine ct of the same day. there is narrowing of the spinal canal at the foramen magnum/level of c1 fracture. narrowing of the spinal canal is resulting from edema of the ligamentum flavum at this level, indenting the dorsal aspect of the spinal cord. there is no abnormal signal within the cord, however. there is vague elevated signal within the interspinous ligament at c4/5, seen on the stir sequence, possibly representing injury. there is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling. there is no evidence of spinal cord edema or hemorrhage. the cervical spinal canal is diffusely, and moderately stenotic, at all levels. at c5/6, there is a small spondylitic ridge spanning from the right neural foramen to the left, indenting the thecal sac ventrally. the disc osteophyte complex does not, however, indent the spinal cord at this level.
no bone marrow lesions are seen that suggest a metastasis. the l5/s1 disc is narrowed and there are mild endplate degenerative changes. there is a large broad-based circumferential disc bulge and there are small facet osteophytes. there is severe stenosis of both foramina with elevation and flattening of the exiting l5 nerve roots. disc material indents the thecal sac as well, more so on the left than the right, but there is no clear s1 nerve root compression. minimal bulging of the t11/12, t12/l1 and l2/3 discs is noted. the conus medullaris is seen at the t12 level and appears normal. minute right renal cysts are noted. there is a partially imaged left renal cyst.
since the previous study, the patient has undergone vertebrectomy with a spacing device and pedicle screws extending from t12 to l4 level. there is laminectomy seen in the upper lumbar region from t12 to l2-3 level. since the previous study, the previously noted enhancing phlegmon in the lumbar spine has considerably decreased. subtle epidural fluid collection posterior to the thecal sac is still visualized at l3 and l4 and l5 level. however, this has considerably decreased. the previously seen paraspinal abscess is also decreased. there is no new area of signal abnormalities seen or evidence of a new epidural abscess identified.
the inversion recovery images demonstrate increased signal within the l2-3 disc with subtle enhancement. this could be secondary to degenerative change, but given the clinical history early discitis could not be excluded and the evaluation is limited secondary to motion. there is no epidural abscess seen in the lumbar region extending from t11 to s3. mild multilevel degenerative changes are identified with disc bulging at l1-2, l2-3 and l3-4 levels. bilateral renal cysts are visualized which were better evaluated with ct abdomen. correlation with that study is recommended. the distal spinal cord shows normal signal intensities.
there are deformities of l4, l1, t12 and t11 consistent with previous compression fractures and vertebroplasty. there is some endplate compression of the superior endplate of l5, which is new compared to the plain film study from ___ with slightly increased signal suggesting a recent endplate compression at this level. there is abnormal signal within the body of the sacrum at the level of s2 and s3, suggesting an insufficiency fracture. there is no evidence of a focal disc protrusion. there is no definite evidence of canal or foraminal stenosis. there is no definite perivertebral mass. there appears to be a remote compression fracture of t10.
as noted previously, the sagittal stir images show diffuse increased t2-weighted signal in the c6 vertebral body with a similar appearance. there is no alignment abnormality. degenerative changes are again noted including mild central canal stenosis involving the levels from c3-c4 through c6-c7, related to small posterior disc protrusions and thickening of the ligamentum flavum. there is no abnormal signal in the cord, upon which there is only mild impression due to the spondylotic abnormalities noted above. the vertebral body height of c6 is preserved. there is only mild patchy enhancement of the c6 body. the overall appearance, including the appearance of thickened trabeculae and intervening fatty regions on a recent ct from ___, is more consistent with a hemangioma. the sagittal stir images show edema in the posterior deep and superficial soft tissues, raising concern for spinous ligamentous injury.
examination is of limited quality due to patient motion. motion is particularly apparent on the stir images. there is edema within the c6 and c7 vertebral bodies, most evident on the stir sequence. the edema is seen throughout majority of both of these vertebral bodies. there is no elevated signal within the c6/7 disc, on the t2 and stir images. marrow signal within the other cervical vertebral bodies is unremarkable. there is no abnormal signal within the spinal cord. at c5/6, there is a small paracentral disc protrusion/osteophyte complex, which indents the thecal sac and approaches the ventral surface of the left side of the spinal cord. a similar finding is noted at c6/7, with a disc osteophyte complex indenting the thecal sac and approaching the ventral aspect of the spinal cord.
the study is limited by patient's motion, particularly post- contrast t1-weighted images. with respect to the vertebral column, there has been no significant change from before. again seen is increased t2 signal within l1/l2, l3/l4, l4/l5, and l5/s1 discs. l1/l2, l3/l4, and l5/s1 discs are moderately to severely decreased in height, while the l4/l5 disc demonstrates herniation into the l4 vertebral body (schmorl's node). the adjacent vertebral body endplates, with the exception of the inferior endplate of l4 related to the aforementioned schmorl's note, show no obvious signal abnormality to definitely suggest osteomyelitis. the heights of the vertebral bodies are maintained, and their alignment is anatomic. regarding the epidural abnormalities, previously seen anterior epidural abnormality extending from l3 through l5 is again present, but now extends from l4 through l5 levels, and most consistent with an epidural phlegmon. posteriorly, in the region of the l3 through l5 laminectomy, there is an additional component with heterogeneously low t1/ high t2 signal and irregular surrounding enhancement, which is new from before and highly suspicious for an abscess, though if there has been intervening surgery, the fluid collection may not necessarily be infected. with respect to the distal spinal cord and cauda equina, the enhancement characteristics are difficult to assess secondary to very limited post- contrast images. there is high degree central canal stenosis at the level of l5, secondary to anterior and posterior aforementioned epidural abnormalities. again seen is a abscess and edema in the right psoas muscle.
correlation is made to plain films of the lumbar spine from ___. the conus medullaris is normal in signal intensity with no abnormal enhancement. the conus normally ends at the l1 level. the cauda equina is normal with no abnormal enhancement. there is no loss of vertebral body heights concerning for compression fracture. at the inferior endplate of l1, there is a small schmorl's node. at l1/2, there is mild decreased t2 signal of the disc and disc space height loss but without a disc bulge or herniation consistent with degenerative disc disease. within the left side of the body of l4, there is a enhancing t1 hypointense and t2 hyperintense lesion, which likely represents an atypical hemangioma. at l4/5, there is mild decreased t2 signal of the disc as well as a mild disc bulge, degenerative changes and the ligamentum flavum and facet joints bilaterally. these findings are not causing canal or foraminal stenoses. at l5/s1, there is decreased t2 signal of the disc as well as moderate disc height loss. there is decreased t1, increased t2 signal, as well as enhancement of the adjacent endplates, which likely represents degenerative type 1 ___ changes. there is no enhancement or increased t2 signal of the l5/s1 disc. extending superiorly from the l5/s1 disc, to the right of the midline, there is a disc herniation. this disc herniation is impinging upon the exiting right l5 nerve root as well as the traversing right s1 nerve root. at the level of the disc, there is a moderate disc bulge as well as a central disc protrusion. there is also moderate degenerative changes of the facet joints and ligamentum flavum bilaterally. these findings are causing moderate canal stenosis, severe right foraminal narrowing, and moderate left foraminal narrowing. there is also narrowing of the left lateral recess for the impingement upon the traversing left s1 nerve roots. no paraspinal soft tissue abnormalities are seen. there are no epidural lesions concerning for abscess/phlegmon.
again metastatic foci are visualized throughout the lumbar vertebral bodies and in this visualized sacrum and both iliac bones. there has been no significant interval change in the distribution and appearances of the metastatic lesions. there is no evidence of new compression fracture identified. subtle soft tissue prominence posterior to the l4 and l5 vertebral body is again noted and is unchanged. no evidence of new areas of soft tissue abnormalities seen. there is no evidence of an epidural abscess identified on the post-gadolinium images. degenerative changes and bulging is seen again at l4-5 level. the distal spinal cord shows normal intrinsic signal.
comparison is made with the prior examination of ___.
at t11-12 and t12-l1, degenerative disc disease is identified. at l1-2, mild retrolisthesis and disc bulging is seen without spinal stenosis. at l2-3 and l3-4, degenerative disc disease and mild bulging is identified. at l4-5, there is grade i spondylolisthesis of l4 over l5 with severe facet degenerative changes. in addition, there is a 1.5-cm cystic area seen adjacent to the right facet joint indenting the thecal sac and severely narrowing the spinal canal. in addition, there is thickening of the ligaments visualized. the combination of changes result in severe spinal stenosis and severe compression of the thecal sac, predominantly on the right side. the cystic area demonstrates peripheral enhancement. this finding is consistent with a large synovial cyst from the right facet joint. in absence of abnormal signal within the adjacent bony structures, this appears to be a degenerative cyst. at l5-s1 level, degenerative disc disease and mild bulging is identified without spinal stenosis. evaluation of paraspinal soft tissues demonstrate left kidney to be smaller than right with prominent renal collecting system. no evidence of paraspinal abscess seen.
from skull base to t4 level, the vertebral bodies demonstrate normal signal without evidence of marrow edema or vertebral malalignment. the prevertebral soft tissue thickness is maintained. the ligamentous structures are intact. the facet joints are normally aligned. at the craniocervical junction and at c2-3, no abnormalities are seen. at c3-4, c4-5 and c5-6, mild bulging and posterior ridging is seen without spinal stenosis. at c6-7, no abnormalities are identified. at c7-t1 and t1-2 mild degenerative disc disease is identified. inferiorly to t4-5, no abnormalities are identified. the spinal cord demonstrates a small area of increased signal in its midportion at c6 level, which could be secondary to slightly prominent central canal or a tiny syrinx. this could be an incidental finding, but clinical correlation with patient's symptomatology is recommended to determine the significance of this finding.
correlation is made to ct of the abdomen and pelvis from the same date. there is mild scoliosis of the lumbar spine curving to the left. no fractures are seen. there is no loss of vertebral body heights. at t10/11, there is a small disk protrusion without canal or foraminal narrowing. at l1/2, there is severe loss of the disk space height with increased t2 signal centrally as well as a disk bulge. these findings are causing mild bilateral foraminal narrowing. at l2/3, there is a moderate disk bulge as well as mild degenerative changes of the facet joints and ligamentum flavum. there is also dorsal epidural lipomatosis. these findings are causing moderate canal stenosis. small joint effusion is seen within the right facet joint. at l3/4, there is severe loss of the disk space height with fluid centrally within the disk. there is also mild disk bulge and a large right paracentral disk extrusion heading inferiorly compressing the right side of the thecal sac and contacting the right cauda equina. there are mild degenerative changes of the facet joints and ligamentum flavum as well as dorsal epidural lipomatosis. this combination of findings is causing severe canal stenosis and severe right foraminal narrowing. at l4/5, there is an inferior schmorl's node of l4 with fluid within the disk centrally. there is also a large central disk protrusion indenting the thecal sac and contacting the cauda equina. there are moderate degenerative changes of the ligamentum flavum and facet joints bilaterally with a joint effusion in the right facet joint. there is also moderate epidural lipomatosis at this level. this combination of findings is causing severe canal stenosis as well as severe right foraminal narrowing. at l5/s1, there is moderate loss of disk space height with central fluid and mild disk bulge and degenerative changes of the facet joints but no canal or foraminal stenosis. there is increased t2 signal involving the psoas muscles and erector spinae muscles, worse on the right, which may represent edema. there is minimal presacral increased t2 signal, which likely represents fluid.
the c2/3 level is unremarkable. at c3/4, there are disc space osteophytes. there are endplate degenerative changes at c4/5. there is right foraminal stenosis at c5/6. the c6/7 level is relatively normal. there is t1 hypointense tumor involving the posterior inferior aspect of c7, the t1 vertebral body, and the superior posterior aspect of t2. the t1 vertebral body is collapsed and there is resultant kyphosis with dorsal epidural tumor at c7-t1 and t2. tumor extends into the left posterior elements at the c7 and t1 levels. there have been laminectomies at c7 and t1 and there is metallic artifact from multiple pedicle screws and bilateral rods. the subarachnoid space is patent. the spinal cord appears somewhat atrophic at the t1 level and there may be minimal abnormal signal intensity in it.
comparison is made to the post-op studies from ___ and ___ as well as the pre-op study from ___. again seen is artifact from orthopedic hardware consistent with anterior fusion at the c6/7 levels. since the most recent study, there has been increase in the edema and expansion of the cord. on the stir images, the inferior extent of the cord edema and expansion extends past the imaged field of view down past the t3 level. the superior portion of the edema extends now up to the c3/4 level. there likely is enhancement of the cord at the c6/7 level. these findings are concerning for infectious involvement of the cord with worsening edema. again seen is minimal epidural enhancement at the c5 and 6 levels, which likely represents postsurgical change or residual phlegmon. at c5/6, again noted is spondylitic ridge as well as degenerative changes of the facet joints as well as the epidural enhancement. these findings are causing mild canal and moderate foraminal narrowing bilaterally. at c6/7, there is a large spondylotic ridge and degenerative changes of the facet joints as well as the epidural enhancement causing moderate canal stenosis and moderate-to-severe bilateral foraminal narrowing. there is stable enhancement and increased t2 signal of the prevertebral soft tissues as before. the previously seen small collection anterior to the body of c2 is not as well visualized and suggests that this is improved. however, the evaluation of this region is limited due to the lack of axial images. if this area is of continued clinical concern, axial images through this region should be obtained on follow up studies. there is a small focus of apparent increased t2 signal within the cord posterior to the base of the dens which may be artifactual. again seen is stable increased t2 signal of the c5 vertebral body as well as the facets of c6. these findings may represent postsurgical change. air-fluid level is seen within the sphenoid sinus. edema and enhancement of the anterior soft tissues of the neck are again seen, which most likely represent postsurgical change.
there has been interval surgical intervention since the mri from ___ with fusion anteriorly of the vertebral bodies of c5 and c6 and posteriorly of c3 to c7. the extensive t2 hyperintense fluid loculations seen anterior to the cervical vertebrae along the paraspinal and paravertebral spaces anterior to c2-c7 overall appear smaller compared to the earlier examination, although complete evaluation and comparison is limited secondary to hardware artifact in this area. a similar t2 hyperintense signal involving the anterior epidural space ventral to the upper cervical cord from c2 to c3 through c7 to t1 levels is unchanged compared to the prior examination but overall appears a little less extensive. the t1 post-contrast examinations are inadequate to assess whether this material enhances and thus the material within the prevertebral space and the material within the epidural space may be a consequence of surgical intervention or may represent persistence of local infection. on stir images, there is a new hyperintense signal seen within the intervertebral disc at the t2-t3 level. the signal intensity seen within the cervical cord remains essentially homogeneous. limited views of the lung apices reveal bilateral posterior hyperintense pleural collections that could be consistent with fluid versus abscess.
there is evidence of cervical spondylosis with anterior and posterior osteophytes involving the cervical vertebral bodies and disc desiccation. there are disc osteophyte complexes at c2-3, c4-5, with bilateral neural foraminal narrowing and on the right side at c5-6, causing narrowing of the right neural foramen and on the left side at c6-7, causing left neural foraminal narrowing. at c7-t1, there is left focal disc protrusion causing left neural foraminal narrowing. however, assessment is somewhat limited due to motion artifacts. the spinal cord is normal in caliber with no abnormal signal intensity foci. the pre- and para-vertebral soft tissues are unremarkable. the epidural space is unremarkable. on the axial soft tissue images of the neck, no obvious masses noted. however, limited evaluation due to technical reasons.

there is increased cervical lordosis identified. from c1-c7 level, the vertebral bodies demonstrate normal signal and there is no evidence of vertebral malalignment. mild disc bulging is seen from c3-4 to c6-7 without spinal stenosis or high-grade foraminal narrowing. the previously identified abnormal signal anterior to the vertebral bodies and posterior to the spinous processes has resolved. no new areas of abnormal signal seen. there is no evidence of ligamentous disruption identified. the visualized t2 vertebra demonstrate mild superior wedging without abnormal signal indicating chronic compression. there is no evidence of intraspinal hematoma or spinal cord compression. the prevertebral soft tissue thickness is maintained. the spinal cord shows normal intrinsic signal.
there has been no significant interval change. again identified is an enhancing lesion in the superior vermian region and another lesion identified at the region of obex at the cervicomedullary junction. these lesions visualized in the posterior fossa are unchanged when comparison with the previous cervical spine mri. in addition, a small enhancing lesion is seen on the right side of the cord at c6-7 level, which is also unchanged. no definite new enhancing lesions are seen in the cervical spinal canal. in addition, there is no evidence of abnormal signal seen within the spinal cord. mild multilevel degenerative changes are noted. postoperative changes are seen with occipital craniotomy. note is made of enhancing lesions within the right lobe of thyroid, unchanged from previous study.

there is loss of disc height at c6-7. the alignment is grossly normal. there is no abnormal signal within the vertebral bodies or intervertebral discs to suggest discitis or osteomyelitis within the cervical spine. there is disc desiccation at multiple levels. no pre- or paravertebral abnormal signal is seen. there is no evidence of cord compression and no abnormal signal is seen within the cervical spinal cord.
correlation is made to brain mrs ___ ___ as well as a ___ as well as prior mr of the spine from ___. there is new diffuse thick leptomeningeal enhancement involving the entire cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine. leptomeningeal enhancement of the visualized brainstem is again seen. at t2/3 level, there is a dorsal extramedullary intradural enhancing lesion posterior to the cord, which is indenting the cord posteriorly. this lesion measures approximately 1.2 x 0.9 x 2.1 in the transverse, ap, and craniocaudal dimensions. extending from t3-t4, there is an enhancing intramedullary lesion involving almost the entirety of the cord with minimal sparing of the peripheral cord on the right. there is a second enhancing nodule which is smaller in size, immediately inferior to this lesion located at the t5 level. there is surrounding edema and expansion of the cord extending from the c7 to the t6 levels. all of these findings are new since the prior mr of the spine. diffuse enhancement of the cauda equina is seen with a 3-mm enhancing nodule at the periphery of the right side of the cord at the t12 level. there is a similar-appearing 3-mm enhancing nodule, likely involving the left s3 nerve root at the l4 level. the visualized bone marrow signal of the spine is normal. there is no loss of vertebral body heights. at c3/4, there is a medium-sized central disc protrusion which is indenting the anterior thecal sac and contacting the ventral cord. at c4/5, there is a small-sized disc osteophyte complex which is indenting the ventral thecal sac, but not contacting the cord. this is also causing moderate right foraminal narrowing. at c7/t1, there is a small central disc protrusion minimally indenting the ventral thecal sac. at t5/6, there is a small central disc protrusion touching the ventral cord. at t6/7, there is a small central disc protrusion touching the ventral cord. at t8/9, there is small central disc protrusion. at t9/10, there is a small left paracentral disc protrusion. at l3/4, there is mild desiccation of the disc as well as a mild disc bulge, but without canal or foraminal narrowing. at l4/5, there is a mild desiccation of the disc with mild disc bulge with an annular tear on the left without canal or foraminal narrowing. at l5/s1, there is moderate loss of disc space height and desiccation with irregularity of the endplates. there is also a disc bulge and mild degenerative changes of the facet joints. these findings are causing mild right and moderate left foraminal narrowing.
comparison is made to ___. there is decreased t1 signal and increased t2 signal as well as enhancement of the endplates and vertebral bodies adjacent to the l4/5 disc consistent with spondylitic discitis. along the left side of the l4/5 level, there is an approximately 2.3-cm peripherally enhancing lesion with central decreased t1 and increased t2 signal, which may represent an abscess. this finding was not definitely seen on the prior study, although the prior study was markedly limited by patient motion. increased t2 signal within the l4/5 disc is again seen. laminectomy changes are seen at l4 and 5 levels. there is no epidural phlegmon or abscess formation. there is minimal increased t2 signal involving the left psoas muscle, which likely represents myositis.
from t12-l1 to l2-3, no abnormalities are seen. at l3-4 to l5-s1 level, degenerative disc disease and mild bulging is identified. mild anterolisthesis of l4 over l5 due to facet degenerative changes is seen. at l5-s1 level, perineural cysts are visualized in both neural foramina. large perineural cysts are visualized within the sacrum with the largest one on the right side at s1-2 level measuring 3 cm. additional perineural cysts are seen within the sacral spinal canal at s2 level with scalloping of the adjacent bony margins. the visualized lumbar vertebral bodies and sacrum demonstrate normal intrinsic signal without evidence of focal abnormalities suspicious for metastatic disease. the distal spinal cord shows normal signal intensities. an approximately 5-mm low- density area within the right posterior ilium could be due to an incidental bone island.
the patient is status post anterior cervical decompression and fusion of the c6/7 vertebral bodies with hardware in place. the previously noted intraspinal collection is no longer visualized, however, there is new stir hyperintensity within the cord from the c5 to the t3 level. at these levels, the cord appears swollen and occupies most of the central canal without visualization of surrounding csf signal. no definite abnormal enhancement within the cord is identified. there has been significant increase in size and the amount of prevertebral fluid collection which appears to extend above the superior margin of the dens from the surgical site. etnesion below the level of the surgical site is also likely. the maximal ap diameter of this collection is approximately 1.4 cm compared to 0.7 cm preoperatively. enhancement of this collection makes a simple post- surgical fluid collection less likely.
no disc or vertebral pathology is seen at the l1/l2 level. there is mild protrusion of the intervertebral disc at the l2/l3 level and a prominent osteophyte of the right facet. the right l3 nerve root is likely impinged. the spinal canal is moderately-to-severely narrowed at this level. there is right lateral protrusion of the disc at the l3/l4 level with right neural foramina narrowing. there is also significant spinal stenosis at this level. at the l4/l5 level, there is lateral intervertebral disc bulging with severe narrowing of the left neural foramina and severe stenosis of the spinal canal. the left lateral recess at l5 is obliterated. there is no spondylolisthesis. the visualized distal spinal cord, conus medullaris and cauda equina are essentially unremarkable.
t1 sagittal images demonstrate a predominantly anterior epidural collection, most prominent at c6/7 where it measures 1.9 cm x 0.6 cm in the axial plane. this collection occupies approximately 50% of the canal cross- sectional area and causes severe compression of the spinal cord at this level. this collection appears to be subligamentous with caudal extension to approximately the t2/t3 level. the rostral extent of this collection is likely just posterior to the c5 vertebral body; however; this may simply represent prominent epidural veins. additionally, primarily at c6/c7, there is infiltration of the soft tissues of the neural foramina, bilaterally, as well as extension anteriorly, into the prevertebral space. there is a questionable small posterior epidural component at this level as well. post-contrast images of this collection demonstrates central hypointensity with surrounding enhancement, which suggests focal abscess. there is no pathological t2 signal within the cord nor is there pathologic enhancement within the cord or along the cord surface. mild stir hyperintensity of the inferior aspect of the c5 vertebral body, as well as the c6/7 and c7/t1 intervertebral discs, is noted; however only a small portion of the posterior aspect of c6/c7 vertebral disc demonstrates very slight enhancement. thoracic spine mr
no new disc, vertebral, or paraspinal pathology is seen. there is no spinal stenosis or subluxation of the component vertebrae. the visualized cord, foramen magnum, and its contents are unremarkable.

the fluid collection posteriorly at the level of c2-c3 is still present but is smaller than the previous examinations. the degree of kyphosis at c6-c7 is similar to the previous study. there remains contrast enhancement of the c6-c7 disc space. the interspinous distance posteriorly at this level is slightly increased and there is contrast enhancement in the paraspinous region. the fluid collections within the anterior paraspinous musculature appears slightly reduced compared to the previous examinations but are still present. some epidural enhancement at c6-c7 is noted but no definite epidural abscess is seen. the cervical cord remains somewhat irregular in contour with some areas of increased signal within on the sagittal t2-weighted sequence but this overall appears improved compared to multiple previous exams.
there is minimal increased t2 signal within the l4 vertebral body in the location of the burst fracture. there is mild retropulsion of few of the fracture fragments. there is a large degree of loss of the vertebral body height. there is no evidence of neural foraminal narrowing at any level. just posterior to the burst fracture, the retropulsed fragments cause mild-to- moderate spinal canal stenosis. they may impinge upon the traversing l4 nerve roots in the lateral recesses. again the study is moderately limited due to patient motion artifact. there is no high-degree compression of the cauda equina. the remaining vertebral bodies are normal in alignment and marrow signal.

extremely limited study due to motion artifacts. at c3-4, there is moderate spondylo ridge with moderate spinal canal stenosis, compression on the thecal side, and flattening of the ventral aspect of the cord. uncovertebral osteophytes are noted at c4-5, c5-6, and c6-7 with narrowing of the left neural foramina at these levels. however, limited evaluation due to motion artifacts. no abnormal signal intensity noted within the cord.
there has been dramatic interval improvement with reduction in size of the bilateral psoas lesions, since the comparison study of ___. these lesions remain heterogeneous on all sequences, with foci that are hyperintense on both t1- and t2-weighted sequences, most suggestive of organizing/resolving hematoma. these lesions span the imaged portion of the psoas on this study. there is no inflammation of the surrounding peripsoas fat and no evidence of involvement of the adjacent spine, disc space, or neural foramina. gadolinium was not given on this study. the patient's known mesenteric mass is not well seen due to artifact from surgical clips in this locale. incidentally seen are two hyperintense t2 lesions in the kidneys, presumably cysts. conus is normally situated at the l1 level and normal appearance of the cauda equina. lumbosacral vertebral bodies are preserved in height and bone marrow signal. the discs are preserved in height and well hydrated. axial imaging from the l3-4 through l5-s1 level demonstrates no evidence of significant disc herniation, central canal narrowing or neuroforaminal narrowing.
please note the overall study is grossly limited due to lack of gadolinium and extensive patient motion. the study was prematurely terminated due to the extensive patient motion during image acquisition. given these limitations, there has been minimal change in the inflammatory changes involving the medial psoas muscles bilaterally, left greater than right. changes indicative of underlying discitis and osteomyelitis with low t1 signal at l4-l5 and corresponding high signal on t2-weighted images and stir sequences involving the endplate and intervertebral disc are unchanged. mild soft tissue prominence in the paravertebral location does not appear significantly changed and there is no evidence of underlying abscess. patient is again noted to be status post l4 and l5 laminectomy and there is stable appearance to grade 1 anterolisthesis of l4 on l5.

at c3-4, there is a large posterior osteophyte with ligamentum flavum thickening. this results in severe spinal canal stenosis. it is difficult to determine whether there is increased t2 signal within the cord at this level based on the sagittal stir images, but the axial t2 images do indicate that there is likely abnormal signal present. the degree of canal stenosis continues to be severe in both flexion and extension but the compression of the cord appears to be slightly more significant during extension. at c4-5 and c5-6 there are small posterior osteophytes causing only minimal spinal canal narrowing. these additional levels do not appear to cause any spinal cord compression.
there is no evidence of focal disc protrusion. there is no evidence of canal or foraminal stenosis. there is no evidence of abnormal signal to suggest the presence of marrow or ligamentous injury. the region of the foramen magnum is not remarkable. there is no evidence of abnormal cord signal.

the conus terminates normally at l1. it has a normal intrinsic signal. the lumbar spine is normal in alignment. at l4-5, there is a large central disc herniation causing severe spinal canal stenosis. this compresses the traversing right l5 nerve root and likely also compresses the traversing left l5 nerve root. there is moderate to severe left and severe right neural foraminal narrowing. there is likely also compression of the right l4 nerve root. at l5-s1, there appears to be an anomalus articulation present along the expected location of the right s1 lamina. some prominent osteophytes are noted about this area. more detailed evaluation could be obtained by a ct of these.
the study is limited due to motion artifacts on the axial sections. on the sagittal images, the bone marrow of the vertebral bodies, throughout the spine appears to have heterogeneous signal intensity. no focal abnormalities are noted on the stir images. no abnormal foci of enhancement on the post-contrast images. the spinal cord is of normal caliber and signal intensity. no abnormal foci of enhancement are noted in the spinal cord. the pre- and para-vertebral soft tissues are unremarkable. perineural cysts are noted at s2, s3 levels. mild degenerative disc disease is noted at multiple levels - c5-6, c6-c7, with mild indentation on the thecal sac, inadequately evaluated on the axial sections due to motion artifacts. a transitional vertebra noted at l5-s1 level. disc desiccation is noted at all the levels in lumbar spine with mild disc bulge at l4-5.

since that examination, there has been a large amount of posterior displacement of the dens and anterior arch of c1 with at least 8 mm worth of posterior displacement. there is now severe canal compromise at the foramen magnum as well as cord compression as evidenced by increased t2 signal within the spinal cord at this level. dr. ___ was informed of these findings by telephone at 1:15 p.m. on ___. there is fluid within the fracture plane with separation of the fracture fragments. there is prevertebral soft tissue edema present. the remainder of the cervical spine shows no evidence of bone marrow edema or abnormal alignment. there is soft tissue edema in the prevertebral space and nasopharynx and anterior to the c1 vertebral body.

hyperintense stir signal involves the posterior aspect of the c7 vertebral body, though no significant height loss or alignment abnormality is identified. there is equivocal high signal at the anteroinferior corner of c7, in the approximate location of the anterior longitudinal ligament. in retrospect, on recent ct, there may be a faint cortical defect with separate calcification, of unclear chronicity. there is no subluxation of component vertebrae, and the cord signal is within normal limits. high stir signal along the posterior soft tissues of the upper cervical spine may represent edema related to injury.
vertebral body height and alignment is normal. there is no bone marrow edema within the vertebral bodies. the known fracture of the right transverse process of c4 is better demonstrated on the preceding ct scan, as the paucity of bone marrow within the transverse processes makes mr less sensitive for fractures in this location. there is possible minimal edema in the prevertebral soft tissues anterior to c2 through c4. there is no evidence of ligamentous disruption or edema. the spinal cord appears normal in morphology and signal intensity without evidence of compression. the craniocervical junction appears unremarkable. degenerative changes are present at multiple levels, as detailed below. at c2/3, there is no spinal stenosis or neural foramen narrowing. at c3/4, there is a posterior endplate osteophyte ridge resulting in mild central canal stenosis and moderate narrowing of the right and left neural foramina. at c4/5, there are small posterior endplate osteophytes without any associated central stenosis or neural foramen narrowing. at c5/6, there is a posterior endplate osteophyte ridge and a mild disc bulge, resulting in moderate narrowing of the right and left neural foramina. there is no significant central canal stenosis. at c6/7, there are posterior endplate osteophytes resulting in mild narrowing of the left neural foramen. there is no central stenosis. at c7/t1, there is no spinal stenosis or neural foramen narrowing. fluid is noted in the posterior nasopharynx and oropharynx, associated with a nasogastric tube. a preliminary report of no evidence of cord injury or ligamentous injury was given to dr. ___ at 8:30 pm on ___.

comparison is made to a ct of the cervical spine from ___. the visualized brainstem, cervical cord, and upper thoracic cord are normal in signal intensity. there is accentuated lordosis of the cervical spine. the atlantoaxial and atlanto-occipital relationships are normal. tiny amount of fluid is seen along the atlantoaxial articulations bilaterally. tiny amount of joint fluid is also seen in the right c3/4 facet joint and the left c5-6 facet joint but without definite evidence of facet capsular disruption. the visualized ligaments appear intact. there is no prevertebral edema or soft tissue swelling. the visualized bone marrow signal is normal with no loss of vertebral body heights. at c3/4, there is a mild disc osteophyte complex and thickening of the ligamentum flavum posteriorly without canal stenosis. there is mild right foraminal stenosis. at c4/5, there is a mild disc osteophyte complex which is not contacting the ventral cord and there is thickening of the ligamentum flavum posteriorly. these findings are causing mild canal stenosis and moderate bilateral foraminal stenoses. at c5/6, there is a mild disc osteophyte complex which is not contacting the ventral cord and thickening of the ligamentum flavum posteriorly. there is no canal or foraminal stenosis. at c6/7, there is a mild disc osteophyte complex which is not contacting the ventral cord. there is no canal or foraminal stenosis at this level. an endotracheal tube and an orogastric tube are in place with fluid within the oropharynx.
alignment of the cervical spine is normal. there has been laminectomy at the c2 and c3 level. mild degenerative change is noted at the craniocervical junction and at c2-3 and c3-4. the visualized brainstem, cervical cord and upper thoracic cord are normal in signal intensity and caliber. there is no loss of vertebral body height. a c4-5, there is mild bulging of the disc without spinal or foraminal stenosis. at c5-6, mild degenerative disc disease is seen. at c5-6, there is apparent fusion of the vertebral bodies and obliteration of the intervertebral disc space with no abnormal signal within the vertebral bodies. findings are consistent with sequela from prior discitis and osteomyelitis. at c7-t1 and inferiorly at t2-3, mild degenerative changes are noted.
vertebral body heights and alignment appear preserved. there is no abnormal edema to suggest ligamentous injury. a small oblong collection that is t2 hyperintense and isointense on t1 with a faint stir signal is noted along the posterior aspects of the c2 and c3 vertebral bodies suggestive of a small epidural hematoma. there is no evidence of cord compression or abnormal cord signal to suggest underlying cord edema. incidental note is made of a small protrusion at t1-t2, incompletely visualized on the axial images.
abnormal marrow signal and replacement of much of the l1 and l2 vertebral bodies by mass is noted with extension of abnormality into the right l1 pedicle. mass at l1 measures approximately 38 x 28 x 26 mm. associated epidural involvement at l2 causes minimal spinal canal narrowing and there may be a tiny component of epidural involvement at l1. mild narrowing of the right l1/2 neural foramen is also associated. evaluation of the conus and cauda equina is not well evaluated due to artifact but no definite involvement is visualized. the l3/4 disc space appears unremarkable. a mild amount of disc bulge and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy causes mild central canal narrowing at l4/5. mild bulging at l5/s1 is also noted. post-surgical changes in the left nephrectomy bed and cystic invovement of the right kidney are incompletely evaluated.
there is no marrow replacing process within the vertebral bodies of the thoracic spine. no abnormal signal within the cord and no evidence of cord compression. no loss of vertebral body height. no enhancing lesions in the thoracic spine. limited views of the lower cervical spine demonstrate high signal intensity within one of the lower cervical vertebral bodies (possibly c6 or c7) seen on stir images, series 5, image 7. this level is not included on any other series and is difficult to further evaluate.
at the craniocervical junction, severe degenerative changes and thickening of the transverse ligament is identified at the level of dens. there is a small well-defined defect seen on the posterior aspect of the dens at the level of transverse ligament indicative of cystic changes from degeneration. no obvious marrow edema seen or linear defect identified through the dens to indicate a fracture. degenerative changes are also seen at the anterior atlanto-odontoid joint. no evidence of subluxation seen. there is no evidence of abnormal signal seen in the lateral masses of c1 or c2 to indicate fracture. there is no evidence of significant narrowing of the spinal canal seen at c1 level. at c2-3, no abnormalities are seen. at c3-4, there is disc bulging and posterior ridging with moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis and mild spinal stenosis. at c4-5, there is mild bulging and mild foraminal stenosis seen. at c5-6, posterior ridging and bulging identified with moderate right-sided and mild left-sided foraminal stenosis. at c6-7, mild disc bulging identified. from c7-t1 to t3-4 mild degenerative changes noted. there is loss of cervical lordosis but the facet joint alignment is normal. there is no evidence of abnormal signal seen in the ligamentous structures to indicate ligamentous disruption. the prevertebral soft tissue thickness is maintained.
post-surgical changes status post posterior fossa decompression ( c1 laminectomy) and suboccipital cranioplasty are evident with a posterior fluid collection extending down to approximately the c2/3 level following csf signal characteristics and could represent a pseudomeningogele. a smaller, more complex fluid collection extends from c2 through approximately c5 posteriorly and likely represents post op hematoma or seroma. susceptibility artifact within the surgical bed likely represents post- surgical air collections. the more superior fluid collection measures approximately 5.5 x 2.0 x 4.5 cm. a syrinx is again noted extending from c2 to approximately c6/7 and appears decreased in size measuring 6.2 x 3.3 mm today compared to 6.9 x 4.3 mm on ___ at the c3 level. evaluation of post-contrast images reveals anterior and posterior cervical leptomeningeal enhancement which is likely postsurgical. inferior herniation of the cerebellar tonsils appears unchanged.
the normal cervical lordosis is maintained. there is grade 1 retrolisthesis of c6 on c7. intrinsic signal within the spinal cord is within normal limits. contents of the posterior fossa are within normal limits. incidentally noted is mucosal thickening within the sphenoid sinus. at c2-3, there is a mild broad-based disc bulge resulting in mild spinal canal narrowing. the neural foramina appear patent. these findings are unchanged compared to the prior study. at c3-4, a moderate broad-based disc bulge and uncovertebral joint squaring results in moderate spinal canal narrowing and right greater than left neural foraminal narrowing. these findings are unchanged compared to the prior study. at c4-5, there is a mild concentric disc bulge resulting in mild- to-moderate spinal canal narrowing and moderate bilateral, right slightly greater than left, neural foraminal narrowing. facet degenerative changes are also seen at this level. these findings are unchanged. at c5-c6, the central spinal canal appears widely patient. the right neural foramina is narrowed by disc osteophyte complex, as before. at c6-c7, a concentric disc bulge is noted, with disc osteophyte complex asymmetric on the right, flattening the thecal sac, and resulting in moderate spinal canal narrowing and moderate-to-severe bilateral neural foraminal narrowing. these findings are also unchanged. at the c7-t1 level, no significant findings are noted.
post-operative changes status post l3-l5 fusion are again seen. pedicle screws and paraspinal rods are noted, creating susceptibility artifact that obscures evaluation of the adjacent structures. evaluation of the integrity of this fusion hardware is not possible on mr. there is maintenance of the normal lumbar spine lordosis with a grade 1 retrolisthesis of l1 on l2 and l2 on l3 as well as a grade 1 anterolisthesis of l5 on s1. vertebral body heights are maintained. schmorl's nodes are seen at t12, l1, l2, and l3. a t1/t2 hyperintense hemangioma is seen in the l1 vertebral body. conus terminates at l1 with no evidence of intrinsic cord signal abnormality. evaluated only on sagittal images are concentric disc bulges at t11-t12, t12-l1, and l1-l2. at l2-l3, there is a concentric disc bulge. no central canal stenosis is seen. post-operative changes status post laminectomy are noted with granulation tissue seen along the posterior aspect of the thecal sac. however, the extent of granulation tissue is difficult to assess due to the absence of intravenous contrast and susceptibility artifact from the hardware. foramina cannot be assessed due to the hardware. at l3-l4, no recurrent disc bulge is seen. central canal is patent. postoperative changes status post laminectomy are noted again with granulation tissue extending along the posterior aspect of the thecal sac. the extent of the granulation tissue is difficult to assess due to the hardware. at l4-l5, there is a mild concentric disc bulge. postoperative changes status post laminectomy are again seen, with extensive granulation tissue seen posterior to the thecal sac. again, evaluation of the full extent of granulation tissue in the neural foramina is obscured by the susceptibility artifact from the hardware. at l5-s1, there is a moderate concentric disc bulge with central t2 hyperintense annular tear. again, postoperative changes status post laminectomy are noted. the foramina cannot be evaluated due to susceptibility artifact from the hardware, although there appears to be foraminal narrowing bilaterally. along the posterolateral aspect of the central canal at this level extending along the anterior aspect of the facet joint and inferiorly into the right s1 neural foramen is a heterogeneously t2 hyperintense and t1 hypointense process that exerts mass effect on the exiting right s1 nerve root. in addition, t1 hypointense/t2 hypointense granulation tissue is seen extending around the left lateral and anterolateral aspect of the thecal sac, surrounding the descending left s1 nerve root, most likely representing granulation tissue. atrophy of the psoas musculature is seen on the left. there is also atrophy of the paraspinal musculature. prevertebral soft tissues are notable for a 5 cm t2 hyperintense lesion of the right kidney near the upper pole, not further characterized on the current study. on the sagittal images, there is an anterior epidural process seen dorsal to the l3, l4, and l5 vertebral bodies. this process t1/t2 hyperintense and may simply represent prominent epidural fat, particularly given the absence of mass effect on the anterior aspect of the thecal sac in these levels.
vertebral body height, alignment and bone marrow signal is normal, without evidence of a fracture. there are no signal abnormalities in the spinal ligaments or paravertebral soft tissues to suggest traumatic injury. the spinal cord appears normal in morphology and signal intensity. at c3/4 and c4/5, there are small right paracentral disc protrusions with associated uncovertebral osteophytes, which result in moderate narrowing of the right neural foramina. at c5/6, there are minimal bilateral uncovertebral osteophytes without any significant narrowing of the central canal or neural foramina. at c6/7 and c7/t1, there is no spinal stenosis or neural foramen narrowing. a 9 mm round focus of high t2 signal in the anterior right neck at the level of the larynx corresponds to the right thyroid nodule identified on the ___ ct scan. there are secretions in the trachea surrounding the endotracheal tube. there is a retention cyst in the sphenoid air cell.
the study is somewhat limited due to patient motion artifact. there is no evidence of spinal canal narrowing or abnormal intrinsic cord signal. no enhancing abnormalities are noted. the region at the level of t11, there is distortion of the conus due to anterior field artifact. evaluation of the lumbar spine demonstrates no significant change since the prior examination of ___. again there is a tiny annular tear at l4-5 with a small central and left paracentral disc herniation. there is minimal narrowing of the left subarticular recess but no direct neural impingement. the conus terminates normally at l1 and has normal intrinsic signal. there are no enhancing abnormalities. the region of the t11 vertebral body does not demonstrate any abnormal bone marrow.
from craniocervical region to t3 level there is no evidence of spinal cord compression or intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities identified. degenerative changes are seen from c2-3 to c6-7. at c7-t1, mild anterolisthesis of c7 over t1 is seen secondary to degenerative change. inferiorly, no evidence of significant disc bulge is noted.
compared to the prior examination of ___, there has been progressive loss of vertebral body height of l2. there has been no retropulsion of bone fragments. the conus terminates normally at l2 and has a normal intrinsic signal. there is no evidence of spinal canal stenosis. there continues to be some slight edema present within the l2 vertebral body as well as some type 1 ___ changes surrounding the l5-s1 disc space. the previously noted degenerative disc disease is unchanged. there are no enhancing abnormalities.
there is a l1 anterior compression fracture with approximate 50% percent of loss of height anteriorly. there is bone marrow edema present within the vertebral body. there is mild retropulsion of bony fragments posteriorly which result in at least moderate spinal canal narrowing. there is posterior displacement of the thecal sac. in addition, there is a small epidural hematoma, which extends inferiorly from l1 and courses posteriorly at the level of l2. at the level of l2, there is no significant thecal sac compression. the remaining vertebral bodies appear normal in alignment and shape.
from t9-10 to t12-l1, degenerative disc disease is seen. at t11-12 and t12-l1, mild disc bulging is noted slightly indenting the thecal sac. the l1 vertebral body demonstrates mild-to-moderate compression predominantly in the anterior portion. the superior endplates demonstrate compression posteriorly with increased signal on inversion recovery images and decreased signal on t1-weighted images indicative of acute/subacute compression. there is no significant retropulsion or compression of the spinal cord seen. at l1-2, disc demonstrate mild bulging without spinal stenosis. there is no foraminal narrowing seen. at l2-3, l3-4, and l4-5 degenerative disc disease and mild bulging is identified. there is mild-to-moderate narrowing of both neural foramina at l3-4 level and moderate left foraminal stenosis at l4-5 level. at l5-s1 level, degenerative disc disease and bulging seen without spinal stenosis. the distal spinal cord shows normal signal intensities. the paraspinal soft tissues are unremarkable.
significantly limited study as above. within these limitations, there is diffuse hypointensity of the vertebral bodies on all sequences, consistent with the patient's known renal disease. the alignment of the vertebral bodies remains grossly maintained. there is no high-grade central canal narrowing. the conus terminates at l1 and is normal in shape and signal intensity. there is disc desiccation and intervertebral disc space narrowing involving the levels of l4-5 and l5-s1.
again noted the fractures involving the c2 and c4 with the retropulsed fragments of c4, along with mild epidural hematoma at c4-5 level, causing mild cord compression and obliteration of the ventral thecal sac. increased signal intensity is also noted on the stir images in c5 and c6 vertebral bodies, from post-traumatic edema/contusion. in the spinal cord, at c4-5 level, there are areas of increased signal intensity in the midline and to the right side, most likely due to contusion. there is ligamentous disruption at c4-5, involving the ligamentum flavum. in addition, multilevel interspinous ligament disruptions are noted. the anterior longitudinal ligament appears to be intact. small amount of retropharyngeal edema is noted from c2-c5 levels. however, there is no compromise of the nasopharyngeal airway.
the study is somewhat motion-degraded. within limits of the examination, no abnormality is noted. specifically, there is no evidence for compression fracture, cord contusion or epidural hematoma. the cervical vertebral bodies are normal in signal intensity, morphology and alignment.
image quality is significantly degraded due to patient motion. at the c3/4 interspace, there is posterior osteophyte formation causing mild- to- moderate canal stenosis. at c4/5, posterior osteophytes also cause mild-to-moderate canal stenosis. at c5/6 and c6/7, there is moderate-to-severe canal stenosis secondary to osteophyte formation. no gross signal abnormalities are seen within the visualized spinal cord to suggest cord compression.
of note is that the study is limited due to the lack of intravenous contrast. in addition, the image quality is quite limited- if possible, the patient should be brought back to repeat the examination. since the prior study, the patient has undergone a bilateral laminectomy at the level of l5-s1. there is a small area of t2 hyperintensity posterior to the thecal sac at this level which may be a small area of fluid. there remains amorphous soft tissue anterior to the thecal sac which narrows the central canal. however, without intravenous gadolinium it is difficult to distinguish between disc material or scar tissue. there remains severe neural foraminal narrowing on the right and moderate neural foraminal narrowing on the left, unchanged. there is a t1 hypointense rounded lesion which is slightly t2 hyperintense involving the left aspect of the l4 vertebral body. given its t1 hypointensity, this lesion is suspicious and requires further evaluation. the conus terminates normally at the level of t12-l1.
since that examination, the amount of fluid within the l4-5 disc space has slightly decreased, indicating a mild improvement. there is no evidence of an epidural abscess. enhancement within the adjacent vertebral bodies has also slightly improved. the amount of edema within the l4-5 vertebral bodies is unchanged. the alignment of the l4-l5 vertebral bodies is also unchanged. enhancing paraspinal soft tissue is again noted and not significantly changed from the prior examination. there does not appear to be significant psoas enhancement on today's exam which may indicate mild improvement in the degree of inflammatory change to the psoas. again there is unchanged severe spinal canal narrowing at l2-3 and multilevel degenerative disc disease as before. the tiny amount of increased t2 signal within the l3-4 disc is unchanged from the prior examination with no enhancement.
this study is limited by technique, particularly involving the axial images. at the level of c5-6, there is a tiny area of t2 hyperintensity within the cord posteriorly which is felt to likely be due to artifact. however, if a lesion within the dorsal columns is consistent with the patient's clinical symptoms, recommend repeating the study to confirm the presence of this lesion. the vertebral body heights, alignment, and intervertebral disc spaces remain preserved. no large disc protrusions are noted. the paraspinal soft tissues are grossly unremarkable.
the marrow is noted to be somewhat heterogeneous which may be related to the patient's known renal disease. otherwise, the vertebral body heights, alignment, and disc spaces appear preserved. as on the prior examination, there is a large disc protrusion at the level of l4-5 which has migrated superiorly posterior to the l4 vertebral body. it causes severe narrowing of the lateral recess and the subarticular recess on the right with compression of the traversing l4 and l5 nerve roots, as noted on the prior study. there is also moderate narrowing of the left neural foramen as well as moderate-to-severe narrowing of the right neural foramen. at approximately the level of s4, there is a linear area of t1 hypointensity and t2 hyperintensity which correlates to the fractures seen on the plain films of the sacrum of ___. this may represent an acute nondisplaced fracture. the native kidneys are noted to be atrophic. there is a transplant kidney in the right hemipelvis.
at the craniocervical junction, no abnormalities are seen. at c2-3 and c3-4, mild disc bulging identified. from c4-5 to c6-7, there is mild disc bulging identified. mild right-sided foraminal stenosis is seen at c4-5 level and mild bilateral foraminal stenosis is seen at c5-6 and c6-7 levels. there is no evidence of intraspinal fluid collection or abscess identified. from c7-t1 to t4-5, no significant abnormalities are seen. the spinal cord shows normal signal intensities on t2-weighted images. the inversion recovery images are somewhat limited by motion for evaluation of signal abnormalities. no evidence of marrow edema or compression fracture seen. no abnormal enhancement identified.
the c1 burst fracture is better appreciated on the ct images of one day previous. other cervical vertebral body heights are maintained. mild anterolisthesis of c4 on c5 is better appreciated on the recent ct evaluation. there is a large retropharyngeal hematoma spanning the entire anterior aspect of the cervical spine. it is difficult to evaluate for a mild interval change in the size of this hematoma given differences in technique. there is no definite epidural hematoma component. there is no evidence of cord edema or hematoma. axial t1-weighted fat-saturated images are nondiagnostic due to gross patient motion.
again postoperative changes are seen in the occipital region with a slightly t1 hyperintense enhancing lesion adjacent to the cervicomedullary junction posteriorly measuring 1.6 cm. encephalomalacia is seen with atrophic change in the cerebellum as was seen on the previous mri. in the cervical region, mild degenerative disc disease is identified from c4-5 to c6-7 with mild bulging. there is no spinal stenosis identified. no evidence of high-grade foraminal narrowing seen. the spinal cord shows normal intrinsic signal without extrinsic compression in the cervical region.
there is an acute fracture through the large anterior osteophyte at the c3/4 interspace, with increased surrounding t2 signal, and extensive prevertebral soft tissue swelling. extensive prevertebral soft tissue swelling extends nearly the entire length of the cervical spine, and likely represents ligamentous injury, although no overt tear is seen in the anterior longitudinal ligament. there is no spinal stenosis or subluxation of the component vertebrae. the visualized spinal cord, foramen magnum, and its contents are unremarkable.
there are postoperative changes identified with fusion from c5 to c7 level with anterior plate and screws. at the craniocervical junction and c2-3, mild degenerative changes are noted. at c3-4, mild bulging and mild left foraminal stenosis seen. at c4-5, there is posterior ridging and bulging with mild left foraminal stenosis. from c5 to c7, there has been fusion. the spinal canal is patent. the foramina demonstrate no evidence of high-grade stenosis although the evaluation is slightly limited by metallic implants and artifacts. at c7-t1 to t3-4, no abnormalities are identified. the spinal cord shows normal signal intensities without extrinsic compression. no evidence of intraspinal mass identified. there is fluid seen within the nasopharynx secondary to intubation. no obvious soft tissue masses are identified in the peri-spinal region.
the conus terminates normally at l1 with normal intrinsic signal. the lumbar spine is normal in alignment and marrow signal. at l4-5, there is a very large superiorly directed disc extrusion present. this causes narrowing of the subarticular recesses at l4-5 with encroachment upon the traversing l5 nerve root. there is mild spinal canal narrowing at this level. the superiorly directed extrusion lies just to the right of midline and causes severe compression of the traversing right l4 nerve root in its lateral recess. there is bilateral moderate neural foraminal narrowing at l4-l5 due to degenerative facet changes. incidental note is made of a pelvic kidney from the patient's renal transplant. no enhancing lesions are noted.
the images are of poor quality due to gross patient motion, and are nearly uninterpretable. there is no overt malalignment of the component vertebra. there is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling. there is edema within the subcutaneous tissues in the upper thoracic spine. there is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling. sagittal images demonstrate evidence of moderate cervical spondylosis at multiple levels, and at least moderate cervical spine stenosis at multiple levels.
the sagittal inversion-recovery images are limited by motion. as reported by history, there is increased signal seen within the distal sacrum with s4 level indicative of fracture. mild edema is seen in the surrounding soft tissues. in the lumbar spine, there is no evidence of an epidural abscess identified or abnormal fluid collection seen. mild degenerative disc disease is seen at l4-5 level with bulging without spinal stenosis. the distal spinal cord shows normal signal intensities. in the visualized pelvis, a small amount of free fluid is visualized.
this examination is becoming available for review on ___. abnormal signal within c6 and c7 is identified consistent with the findings on the patient's ct scan. there is abnormal cord signal consistent with edema or contusion. this abnormal cord signal extends from c5 to t1. there is abnormal signal posteriorly in the region of the interspinous ligament extending from c3 to c7. there is some increase in prevertebral signal to the fracture region consistent with some anterior ligamentous disruption. there is moderately severe cord compression at the level of c7. there is bilateral foraminal compromise as well.
there are several areas of altered signal intensity in the lumbar vertebral bodies, consistent with metastatic involvement. there is also involvement of the sacral body and the right hemi-sacrum by metastasis, with extension through the sacral foramina. this is however better evaluated on the mri of the hip done the day before, on ___. axial sections were obtained from l2-s1 level. the metastatic lesions are better seen on the axial t1-weighted images than axial t2-weighted images, which are limited by some motion. at l4-5 level, there is a 2.1 cm area of altered signal intensity in the right side of the superior part of the l5 vertebral body, including the posterior margin with possible extension into the spinal canal at this level. in addition, there is a 1.3 x 0.7-cm focus in the right lateral recess, which appears to be contiguous with the above-mentioned metastatic focus in the l5 vertebral body. however, this was seen on the prior study on ___, and interpreted as disc protrusion. on the present study, due to lack of iv contrast, it is difficult to ascertain whether this represents disc material or tumor. there is possible impingement/encasement of the traversing right l5 nerve root at this level. no pre- or para-vertebral soft tissue masses are noted. the spinal cord ends at t12-l1 level. the roots of the cauda equina are unremarkable. the spinal canal at the t11 level, included on the uppermost aspect of the field of view, appears unremarkable on the t1-weighted images and increased signal within the spinal canal on the sagittal t2-weighted images could be artifactual.
the visualized portions of the cerebellum and associated post- operative change have not significantly changed since ___. there is an unchanged fluid collection deep to the cerebellar titanium plate. it appears extradural on the sagittal t1 images. mild enhancement is again demonstrated in the superficial soft tissues of the neck in this region, and this is also unchanged from ___. however, there is new thick enhancement demonstrated at the superficial margin of the suboccipital prosthesis. enhancement also extends to a small fluid collection just to the right of midline in the posterior occiput measuring 1.7 x 1.2 cm, which could be consistent with a sinus tract. the appearance is most suggestive of a small abscess as the collection has a thick enhancing rim. this collection appears continuous with the previously mentioned enhancement which extends along the superficial surface of the suboccipital prosthesis. based upon this finding, the concern is that the prosthesis may be involved with the infection. there are also more superficial areas of loculated fluid in the soft tissues of the posterior neck, which demonstrate some new enhancement. one focal area to the left of midline contains t1 bright signal, and could represent a small area of blood product, or an isolated rest of focal fat.
there is no comparison mr examination on record and the study is compared with axial images and sagittal reformations from recent torso ct, dated ___. the lumbar vertebrae are normal in height, signal intensity and alignment, with no focal t1-hypo- or stir-hyperintensity to suggest a marrow- replacing process. furthermor,e there is no medullary pathologic focus of enhancement. no enhancing or other paraspinal soft tissue mass is identified and there is no pathologic leptomeningeal or nerve root enhancement (though the axial post-contrast sequences are somewhat degraded by motion artifact). the conus medullaris is normal in morphology and terminates at the lower t12 level, there is normal distribution of nerve roots within the thecal sac and the spinal canal is widely patent at all imaged levels. there is isolated desiccation of the l4-5 disc with mild diffuse bulging and a shallow central protrusion which only slightly indents the ventral aspect of thecal sac. sagittal and axial t1-weighted sequences suggest the presence of bilateral l5 pars interarticularis defects, which appear confirmed on the recent ct examination; however, there is no evidence of spondylolisthesis or resultant neural foraminal narrowing and there is no evidence of bone marrow edema in the posterior elements to specifically suggest instability at this level. incidentally noted is loculated fluid, without enhancing rim, in the subcutaneous soft tissues extending over roughly 15 cm (cc), likely simply representing dependent edema. limited imaging of the retroperitoneum demonstrates no adenopathy.
there is no evidence of focal disc protrusion. there is no evidence of canal stenosis. there is irregularity of the facets at both l4-5 and ___ bilaterally. there is no evidence of canal or foraminal stenosis. marrow signal is diffusely reduced on all sequences, and the marrow does not significantly enhance. this is consistent with fibrosis of the marrow. there is hemangioma within the body of l5. there is no evidence of paravertebral mass. the conus is not remarkable.
the vertebral alignment is normal. there are no signal abnormalities in the bone marrow, in the spinal ligaments, paraspinal soft tissues, or the spinal cord to suggest acute traumatic injury. mildly elevated t2 signal in the paratracheal and paraesophageal soft tissues, which are distinct from the prevertebral soft tissues, is felt to be related to instrumentation and/or secretions. spondylosis without significant central canal narrowing is present at c4/5, c5/5, and c6/7. findings were discussed with dr. ___ at 6 p.m. on ___.
large amount of fluid is again noted within the l4-5 disc space, and there has been progression of bony destruction of the adjacent vertebral body endplates. extensive edema and enhancement of the l4-5 endplates has also progressed. these findings are consistent with progression of l4-5 discitis/osteomyelitis. enhancing paraspinal soft tissue is again noted, most prominently to the right posterior region of the l4-5 disc level. this enhancement extends into the psoas muscle. no definite psoas abscess is present. note is again made of right l4-5 hemilaminectomy. enhancing tissue is again seen in the postoperative region, but no fluid collection is seen in this area. small rounded structure just inferior to the l4-5 level has slightly changed in signal characteristics, and is less apparent on current study. this could continue to represent a synovial cyst, alternatively an extruded disc fragment could have a similar appearance. again noted is severe spinal canal stenosis at l2-3 secondary to thickening of the ligamentum flavum, disc bulge, and facet osteophytes. superior to this, there is nerve root redundancy indicative of significant canal stenosis. multilevel degenerative changes at other disc levels are not significantly changed.
due to technical reasons the mri study of the lumbar spine was limited in evaluation. the vertebral alignment appeared normal. the vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs demonstrated normal signal intensities. the non-enhanced mri sequences did not demonstrate any evidence of discitis or osteomyelitis. there is linear hyperintensity demonstrated in the anterior epidural space at the level of l3 and l4 which may represent hemorrhage. also just posterior to the vertebral body there is hypointensity visualized in the anterior epidural space which may represent an infectious small collection vs. just prominent epidural veins. however evaluation was limited due to the non-contrast nature of the study. overall the spinal canal appeared small. the distal cord, conus medullaris, cauda equina demonstrated normal signal intensities. the pre- and paravertebral soft tissues appeared normal. the neural foramina and lateral recesses at all levels appeared normal.
the alignment of the lumbar spine is normal. no vertebral body signal abnormalities are identified, and there is no loss of vertebral body height. the l1-2, l2-3, and l3-4 discs are normal in appearance. at these levels, there is no evidence of canal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing. at l4-5, there is an annular tear and concentric disc bulge involving both subarticular recesses. there does not appear to be significant canal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing. at l5-s1, there is an annular tear with minimal posterior disc bulge. no canal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing is identified. surrounding soft tissues are unremarkable.
this study is again limited significantly by motion artifacts, especially the axial t2 and the sagittal post-contrast sequences. axial post-contrast sequences were not performed due to patient motion. bilateral large pleural effusions are noted. the spinal cord is normal in caliber. in the lower portion of the cord, there is mild enhancement noted on the surface of the right side of the cord (series 9, image 12); it is unclear if this appearance is real or artifactual, related to patient motion. correlation with axial t2-weighted images for better assessment of this mild emhancement is limited due to motion artifacts on the axial t2 sequences. there is no evidence of compression in the thoracic cord. . no pre- or paravertebral soft tissue masses or enhancement are noted in the thoracic spine.
