tiny well-circumscribed pelvic hematoma. the appearances would not necessarily explain a 12 point hematocrit drop.
thickening of the left posterolateral bladder wall without abnormal enhancement is probably due to post-surgical change from the left ureteral re-implantation surgery. susceptibility artifact from surgical clips in the left pelvis limit evaluation of this area, but taking this into account, there is no evidence of local recurrence in the left paravaginal or pararectal areas. there are no areas of abnormal enhancement in the pelvis.
1. no evidence of dvt. 2. two pelvic lesions as described that might represent either primary adnexal masses or secondary involvement from known breast cancer. further evaluation may be warranted. 3. hyperintense bone marrow regions seen in the ischium and in the femoral heads. this might also be attributed to the patient's primary disease.

enlarging edematous transplant kidney with striated nephrogram, possibly representing rejection vs. infection. areas of decreased enhancement in the upper pole are likely secondary to decreased segmental perfusion. pseudoaneurysm formation at the site of anastomosis. the pseudoaneurysm is bilobed with each lobe measuring approximately 2 cm in diameter. perinephric collection, not well demonstrated previously, but likely unchanged in size from the previous exam. the collection most likely represents evolving postoperative hematoma. thrombosis of the right external iliac artery with reconstitution immediately proximal to the right common femoral artery (at the level of the inferior pole of the transplanted kidney). high signal intensity of the thrombus suggests subacute thrombosis. these findings were discussed with dr. ___ ___ on ___ at 10:00pm.
1. t2 hyperintensity and abnormal enhancement involving bilateral pubic symphysis, compatible with osteomyelitis. 2. fluid collections anterior and posterior to the pubic symphysis and between bilateral symphysis, compabtible with abscesses. sinus tract anterior to the pubic symphysis. 3. although findings are compatible with infection, small tumor involvement of these areas can not be excluded.
1. limited examination demonstrates no evidence of definite tumor recurrence in pelvis. there is no evidence of hydronephrosis. the diverting ileostomy is patent. 2. soft tissue signal at the anterior pelvic floor, which could represent post surgical, radiation changes or inflammation. correlation with clinical exam is advised. see comment.

1) multifocal fluid-containing thick-walled lesions within the bilateral vulva and both groins, left greater than right, with an appearance highly suspicious for vulvar cancer with necrotic lymph nodes along bilateral pelvic nodal chains. irregularity, rim enhancement and surrounding inflammatory fat stranding in the left groin may indicate superimposed infection. 2) extrinsic compression without occlusion of the proximal left external iliac vein just central to the distal left common femoral vein. this extrinsic compression is caused by an adjacent necrotic lymph node. 3) 2-cm mass with papillary surface projecting into the bladder lumen from the right bladder wall has an appearance highly suspicious for transitional cell carcinoma. less likely, this may alternatively represent a bladder wall metastasis. cystocopy is recommended for tissue characterization.
resolution of left psoas collection.
1) stent is demonstrated throughout the length of the distal left ureter which is not dilated. enhancement of the wall of the left ureter may be a result of manipulation due to placement of the stent, or less likely, secondary to inflammation. there is no encasement or mass involving the course of the left ureter. 2) large exophytic cyst related to the left ovary with a smaller adjacent non- enhancing hemorrhagic cyst. follow-up ultrasound in six weeks is suggested, as also suggested on the ultrasound, to document disappearance of this cyst.

stable appearance of sacral mass which is non-enhancing and predominantly of fluid and fat signal intensity, which suggests the diagnosis of teratoma.
1. left sacral decubitus ulcer with abnormal coccygeal signal. osteomyelitis is not excluded. 2. sacral and left iliac lesions are nonspecific and may represent normal red marrow, metastases, or myeloma. clinical correlation is recommended. 3. incompletely imaged right kidney which continues to demonstrate perinephric edema, consistent with the finding of the right ureteral calculus on recent ct scan.
small mass in the spinal canal at s1/2. this could be either skeletal or neurogenic in origin. a ct study is suggested to assess for osseous involvement.
1. asymmetric enlargement of the right labia majora, with edema and asymmetric thickening of the medial aspect of the right labia. this may be secondary to an infectious or inflammatory process, but direct involvement by lymphoma should be considered. 2. no evidence of abscess or fasciitis. 3. superficial subcutaneous edema involving the anterior aspect of both thighs. 4. bilateral iliac lymphadenopathy, left greater than the right. 5. heterogeneous bone marrow signal within the proximal portions of both proximal femurs, likely related to the patient's history of lymphoma. 6. small free fluid in the pelvis.

interval small decrease in size of the enhancing mass lesion at the rectal anastomosis site. the distribution and extension of the mass is the same, with invasion of the posterior wall of the urinary bladder. although the decreased size of the mass suggests interval response to chemotherapy, there are new enhancing lymph nodes in the perirectal distribution, which could be reactive to underlying chemotherapy, however, regional new metastases cannot be excluded. in addition, there is more extensive central enhancement on today's examination, with a decrease in the area of central desmoplastic change (or necrosis) seen on the ___ exam -- the signifiance of this latter finding is uncertain. of note, the liver was not included in the field-of-view on today's images. multiplanar and multiphasic imaging was essential for depiction of anatomy in this case.
prematurely terminated and limited exam, however, still showing copious ascites with features of nodularity and a distended fluid filled uterus with nodule or mass like features centrally. the overall pattern is consistent with uterine cancer, perhaps metastatic and there is evidence of right external iliac adenopathy. the patient can be made comfortable, full evaluation could be achieved with gadolinium injection as clinically indicated.

1. findings highly suspicious for discitis at the l4-5 level. 2. 3.3 x 2.6 x 3.1 cm right adnexal mass, as described above. findings are most consistent with a stromal tumor arising from the right ovary, such as a fibroma, ___ tumor or fibrothecoma. although, no connection to the uterus is identified, a pedunculated fibroid would also be in the differential. hemosiderin within an endometrioma is considered unlikely in someone of this age. 3. findings were discussed with dr. ___ at approximately 10:15 a.m. on this day (___).
widespread osseous metastatic disease to all visualized bones including focal metastases at the s2 level; suspicion for continuity to the exiting s2 nerve root is present, and this may contribute to the patient's symptoms. however, the osseous metastatic lesions on the left as described above may also be contributory. multiplanar reformations were essential in delineating enhancement features in this case.
punctate focus of air in the fundus of the uterus; reconstructed images show thin tracts between the sigmoid colon and the fundus of the uterus highly suggestive of small fistulae. of note, precontrast t1 images show high signal fluid in all bowel contents, however, none is seen in the endometrial cavity. free fluid seen. some third spacing of fluid also noted in a tarlov's cyst was incidentally seen. tiny filling defect in distal right ureter with some enhancement. this is consistent with ureteral stone but small stricture cannot be ruled out. multiplanar reformations were essential in demonstrating the small fistulous tracts as described above.
1. calcified pedunculated fibroid in the pelvis. 2. diverticula in the sigmoid colon without diverticulitis. team contact___ with findings.
1. technically limited study, as described above, due to patient motion as well as some venous contamination, particularly on the right. there is artifact from stents in the region of both proximal common iliac arteries, and these portions of the vessels cannot be evaluated. 2. a long segment of nonvisualization of the right superficial femoral artery. given the abrupt cutoff and reappearance of this vessel, this likely relates to the presence of metallic stents in this region rather than long segment stenosis. clinical correlation is recommended. 3. a somewhat diminutive appearance of the right anterior tibial artery proximally, though this appears improved from the prior mra dated ___. 4. focal high-grade stenosis/occlusion of the proximal aspect of the right dorsalis pedis artery. the more distal vessel appears patent. 5. disease of the right tibioperoneal trunk. 6. multiple focal areas of mild disease within the left superficial femoral artery. 7. focal moderate high-grade stenosis of the distal left popliteal artery, just above the takeoff of the left anterior tibial artery. 8. mild-moderate disease of the left anterior tibial artery and tibioperoneal trunk.

abnormal enlargement and enhancement of the l5, s1 and s2 nerve roots, right greater than left, most notably involving the right l5 nerve root. this has progressed appreciably since the ct of ___ and likely represents lymphomatous involvement.
1. very large right adnexal cystic lesion most consistent with a peritoneal inclusion cyst, not significantly changed since the prior examinations. 2. interval decrease in size of the previously noted right adnexal hemorrhagic cyst. 3. wall thickening and enhancement of the sigmoid colon with adjacent fibrofatty proliferation consistent with the patient's known crohn's disease.

moderate-severe bilateral proximal internal carotid artery stenosis, more on the left internal carotid artery than the right. there is more than 50% stenosis of both internal carotid arteries; exact assessment of stenosis is difficult on mra due to low resolution of the arterial margins. if considered necessary for further management, pt. needs cta with contrast (after precautions) for better assessment of extent of stenosis.
unchanged appearance of a large filling defect within the left internal carotid artery. although no intimal flap is identified, the sensitivity for identifying mural hematoma is low given the suboptimal t1 fat- saturated images. if there is high clinical concern, we can attempt to repeat this sequence.

1. extension of the anterior mediastinal mass into the supraclavicular region and lower part of the neck, approximately 2.5-3 cm below the sternoclavicular junction, along the lateral aspect of the left lobe of the thyroid. 2. difficult to evaluate impingement on the trachea as the patient is intubated with endotracheal tube and endobronchial stent in situ. 3. please also see the detailed report on the ct of the chest without contrast, for details about the pulmonary nodules, etc. 4. moderate opacification of the right maxillary and sphenoid sinuses. 5. multiple scattered lymph nodes in both sides of the neck, largest measuring borderline, 1.5 cm in the long axis in right level 2a. dr.___, the attending radiologist reviewed the study and edited the report.
1. complete occlusion of the right ica throughout its course, with reconstitution of normal flow in a1 and m1 segments and their more distal branches. 2. stent in the distal left cca/proximal ica without hemodynamically significant stenosis. 3. 3-mm inferomedially directed aneurysm with a 2-mm neck originating from the supraclinoid left ica. 4. chronic lacunes in the right basal ganglia and periventricular microvascular ischemic changes.
