1. no evidence of cervical lymphadenopathy by ct criteria. 2. soft tissue nodules in the deep subcutaneous fat of the mid-neck, posteriorly; these may simply represent sebaceous cysts and should be correlated with physical examination. 3. 19-mm low-attenuation nodule in the lower pole of the right lobe of the thyroid gland; if warranted on clinical grounds, this could be further characterized by dedicated son___ (if not performed elsewhere)
round soft tissue mass lesion within the deep portion of the right parotid gland measuring 17 x 19 mm demonstrating internal low attenuation with possible fatty components. differential considerations would include a right sided parotid pleomorphic adenoma, an intraparotid lymph node, or warthin's tumor. ent correlation with possible fna would be helpful to establish a diagnosis.
1. interval decrease in the amount of fluid within the left side of the neck. 2. continued evidence of stranding and lymphadenopathy, particularly within the left side of the neck. 3. continued lack of opacification within the left internal jugular vein. 4. no change in the left thyroid nodule. 5. the left sternocleidomastoid muscle continues to be slightly larger than the right with evidence of low attenuation suggesting edema within the muscle.
1. nonopacification of the left vertebral artery beginning at the level of c7 and extending to approximately the c3 level. beyond this point it appears to be reconstituted by collateral vessels. this nonopacification may be due to dissection, thrombosis or external compression by hematoma. 2. cervical fractures as briefly described above. please see the dedicated ct of the cervical spine performed the same day. these findings were telephoned and discussed with ___ khin, at 10:30 hours, on ___, when the images were reviewed.
stable lesion in the right lobe of the thyroid gland. changes attributable to posterior fossa surgery, residual enhancing nodules consistent with hemangioblastomata again noted.
non-contrast neck ct shows no evidence of fluid collection. no evidence of obvious mass lesion identified.
1. 3.6 cm bilobed abscess within the left sublingual space and periapical lucency involving the left second inferior bicuspid adjacent to this collection. findings are consistent with ludwig's angina. 2. periapical lucency involving the left inferior second molar. 3. polypoid mucosal thickening in the left maxillary sinus. these findings were communicated to the ed dashboard at the time of image acquisition.
1. approximately 2-cm short segment occlusion of the left subclavian vein. opacification of multiple collateral veins in the left upper chest reconstitute flow in left brachiocephalic vein. the superior vena cava is patent. 2. small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusion with adjacent lung atelectasis.
1. occlusion of almost the entire right vertebral artery including segments v1 through v3 with minimal retrograde filling of the v4 (intracranial) segment. this is likely caused by a c2 right lateral process fracture extending into the foramen transversarium causing dissection of the right vertebral artery. 2. the left vertebral, bilateral carotid and basilar arteries are normal. 3. wasp waist configuration and fusion of multiple cervical vertebral bodies and facet joints, which can be seen klippel-feil syndrome.
1. stable right parieto-occipital hemorrhage since the nect head performed 3 hours earlier, with mild increase in surrounding edema and mild increase in the shift of midline structures to the left. 2. cta head demonstrates no signs of avm, aneurysm or cerebral venous thrombosis. however, an occult avm or other vascular anomaly cannot be entirely ruled out due to the mass effect of the hemorrhage/edema. follow-up cta or conventional angiogram is recommended, as warranted clinically. 3. cta neck demonstrates no abnormality. 4. minor subpleural atelectasis and ground glass opacification in the apical-posterior segment of the left upper ___, ___ be related to post-intubation or aspiration. consider ct chest if there is a history of trauma or respiratory symptoms. 5. incidental congenital fusion anomaly in the upper cervical vertebrae.
1. evolving left cerebellar infarction as described above. 2. near complete occlusion of the left vertebral artery from its origin throughout the junction with the basilar artery with associated extensive atherosclerotic disease. 3. almost complete occlusion of the v4 segment of the right vertebral artery. a preliminary report was provided by dr. ___ and was communicated to dr. ___ via phone at 3 a.m. on ___.
heterogeneous. likely fluid collection within the retropharyngeal space likely secondary to postoperative reaction to retropharyngeal- placed carotid-to-carotid bypass. findings were discussed with dr. ___ ___ over the telephone at approximately 4:30 p.m. by drs. ___ and ___. apparently, by then, the et tube was removed and the patient was reported to be breathing normally.
1. no perfusion abnormality. please note that the area of concern on subsequent mr brain is not fully covered by the limited perfusion images. 2. no evidence of significant stenosis within the circle of ___, ___ tributaries, or head and neck vessels. 3. three-mm saccular, narrow necked aneurysm at the origin of the anterior temporal branch of the right middle cerebral artery. 4. minimal hyperdensity within the right parietal subcortical white matter. this is a nonspecific finding, but may be associated with mild calcifications. along with the imaging findings of the mr brain, these could represent fine calcifications associated with a low-grade glioma. 5. 18 x 12 mm left parieto-occipital meningioma. 6. bilateral thyroid nodules.
extensive, but ill-defined edema, centered at the retropharyngeal space but extending, particularly laterally, as a trans-spatial process. there is no discrete rim- enhancing component. overall, the primary consideration is extensive phlegmon, likely related to infection. note that the absence of defined margin does not exclude the possibility of abscess. given the mass-effect of these findings, clinical correlation is recommended to assess for potential need for airway protection.
1. subarachnoid hemorrhage in the basal cisterns with extension into the fourth ventricle. 2. 5-mm right-sided saccular aneurysm of the distal basilar artery, proximal to the superior cerebellar artery origin, which appears to be associated with the origin of a brainstem perforator artery. 3. slight contour prominence in the proximal superior division of the right mca, possibly related to the origin of a small branch that is poorly visualized, but a small aneurysm cannot be excluded. this may be better assessed by conventional angiography, which will presumably be pursued for evaluation of the basilar aneurysm. findings were discussed with the emergency department shortly after image interpretation at 11:15 a.m. on ___.
persistent thickening of the prevertebral and parapharyngeal soft tissues, for which correlation with clinical exam is suggested, as further details are difficult to discern by ct. no discrete fluid collection, however.
