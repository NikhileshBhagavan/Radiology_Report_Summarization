1. misplaced left percutaneous nephrostomy catheter with the pigtail coiled in the lateral perinephric fat. 2. moderate-to-severe left hydroureteronephrosis with extensive perinephric fat stranding and pararenal fascial thickening. this could represent pyelonephritis in a closed urinary collecting system, or post-surgical changes from the recent procedure and displacement of the catheter; although a small amount of extravasated urine cannot be excluded as contributing to this appearance there is not substantial fluid collection. 3. stable thickening of the soft tissues adjacent to the prostate, likely representing prostate cancer, with unchanged paraaortic mass causing left ureteric malignant obstruction. 4. sclerotic appearance of right posterior 10th rib, and adjacent pedicle of the t10 vertebra, with increased uptake seen on bone scan in ___, which may represent an old traumatic injury, however, raises concern for unusual appearance of bony metastatic disease given the patient's history of metastatic prostate cancer. a bone scan would be helpful to evaluate further if clinically indicated and attention to the site in imaging follow-up is also recommended. similar findings are noted in the left eighth rib.
1. distended and fluid filled appendix, compatible with known acute appendicitis. no abscess or perforation. 2. volume overloaded state with cardiomegaly, diffuse soft tissue edema, small pleural effusions, and small ascites. 3. pleural effusions are associated with adjacent compressive atelectasis. 4. t10, l3, and l4 wedge compression deformities.

small hyperintensity seen only on the diffusion-weighted sequence which is too small to fully characterize. this may represent artifact but a tiny acute infarct cannot be excluded. if neurologic abnormalities are referred to this area, followup study could be performed for further evaluation.
1. postoperative changes in the form of right frontal, parietal, and temporal craniotomy with resection cavity in the right temporal lobe. extra-axial fluid collection along the right frontal and parietal convexity which has mildly decreased in size as compared to the prior study. 2. two new nodular enhancing foci posterior and posteromedial to the resection cavity. these are concerning for disease progression. however possibility of treatent related changes cannot be entirely ruled out. 3. the enhancing focus in the right frontal lobe has decreased in size as compared to the prior study. 4. no evidence of acute infarct. these findings were communicated by critical radiological imaging dashboard.
extensive edema in the left frontal lobe extending to the corpus callosum with rim-enhancing masses as described above. the lack of slow diffusion suggest masses to be due to neoplasms. although the masses are in the same lobe with some involvement of the corpus callosum, the appearances are more typical a metastatic disease than a primary neoplasms such as glioma.
1. acute bilateral cerebellar infarcts. 2. subacute bilateral occipital lobes and left temporal lobe infarct. 3. small right vertebral artery without signal within it. it is unclear whether this represents a thrombosed vertebral artery, a small vertebral artery that is too small to demonstrate blood flow or a reversal of flow in this vessel. if indicated, additional evaluation of cta could be performed.
1. persistent small area of nodular enhancement in the left cerebellar hemispheric surgical resection cavity which may represent postsurgical changes versus tumor. needs attention on close followup. however, there is some decrease in the enhancement noted in the surgical resection cavity compared to prior which can relate to post-surgical changes. 2. new, 0.5 x 0.4 cm enhancing lesion in the left frontal vertex, dural- based, represents a new metastatic lesion. attention on close followup is recommended if no intervention is contemplated. findings were informed to dr. ___ ___ by dr.___ on ___ .

1. a large mass measuring 3.2-cm in greatest dimension is present within the left posterior parasagittal parietal lobe. the mass is complex in its signal characteristics demonstrating peripheral irregular enhancement with central non-enhancement as well as peripheral slow diffusion. tumor is felt most likely with central necrosis, although typically, central necrosis has homogeneous t2 hyperintensity centrally whereas this lesion demonstrates t2 isointensity. a complex hemorrhage is a possibility, although the ct obtained at outside institution demonstrates that this mass is not hyperdense, in a patient with anemia, it is possible that the density may be diminished. possibly, both may be the case, a tumor with complex hemorrhage. abscess is considered less likely given that centrally the lesion is hypointense on diffusion with peripheral slow diffusion. 2. multifocal confluent and flair hyperintensities are present within the periventricular and subcortical white matter without restricted diffusion or gradient signal artifact likely representing the sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
1. unchanged appearance of nodular enhancement along the right frontal surgical cavity margins, most of which has persistent slow diffusion. lack of resolution of slow diffusion suggests that these findings represent persistent tumor rather than ischemia. a small nodular enhancing focus along the inferior anterior aspect of the surgical cavity is unchanged in size without evidence of slow diffusion, suggestive of persistent tumor. 2. new punctate enhancing focus with associated high t2 signal in the left frontal deep white matter, concerning for a new metastasis. 3. near complete resolution of vasogenic edema in the right frontal lobe. persistent, though decreased, leftward shift of the septum pellucidum, probably in part related to interval enlargement of the right subdural collection, which is now moderate. 4. persistent, slightly decreased, small right frontal epidural fluid collection. 5. slightly increased bifrontal, left greater than right, subgaleal fluid collection. 6. fluid in the maxillary sinuses, which may indicate acute sinusitis. dfdkq
small isointense t1 and hypointense t2 left tentorial lesion most consistent with a meningioma based on signal intensity values. the location and morphology would be less typical for a hemorrhage. if a more definitive diagnosis is needed, a repeat limited mri with axial t1, gradient echo and t2 images may be obtained in one week to assess for change in the appearance of the lesion, that would typically be seen with a hemorrhage, but not a meningioma. these findings were discussed with dr. ___ on date of the examination at approximately 4 p.m.

1. status post left posterior fossa cranioplasty for resection of left cerebellar mass with air and blood products within the surgical bed and with similar degree of mass effect on the fourth ventricle, left mesencephalic cistern, medulla and left ambient cistern. intrinsic t1 hyperintensity limits evaluation for residual tumor. recommend follow up post resolution of blood products. 2. small focus of slow diffusion along the periphery of the surgical bed may represent infarct. 3. multiple supratentorial and infratentorial lesions as before, largest in the left frontal lobe is similar in size compared to the most recent prior examination.
there is a wedge shaped infarct in the left parietal lobe, most likely within the posterior aspect of the left mca territory. imaging characteristics are most consistent with subacute infarct. the age of the infarct could be confirmed with diffusion weighted images.
1) no structural abnormalities detected to explain the patient's recent seizures.

persistent right frontal subacute intra-axial hematoma with mild surrounding edema. the overall size of the hematoma has decreased since the prior study. the hematoma measures now 3.3 cm x 2.0 cm. patient, however, needs followup examination with post-gadolinium images as an underlying lesion cannot be excluded because gadolinium was not able to be administered as the patient could not finish the examination.
there is slightly increased enhancement along the left tentorium which could still be within the spectrum of post-operative change but would recommend attention on short term followup imaging to exclude recurrence.
again identified are multiple brain metastatic lesions. some of the lesions have slightly increased in size compared to the prior mri of ___ as described above. no significant brain edema is identified.

"advanced" imaging with dedicated perfusion sequences and mr spectroscopy could be performed in an attempt to distinguish these entities. 2. decreased right frontal extra-axial fluid collection.
1. recanalization of the a2 aneurysm, with the current hyperintense outpouching grossly resembling the pre-coiled appearance. 2. multifocal intracranial vasospasm as described. 3. expected evolution of the corpus callosal infarct and right frontal hemorrhage. the attending neuroradiologist, dr. ___ ___, has discussed the urgent findings in detail with the neurosurgery attending, dr. ___ ___, at 4:14 p.m. on ___.
