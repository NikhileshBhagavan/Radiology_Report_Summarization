1. no acute intracranial abnormality. 2. generalized parenchymal atrophy with changes of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. 3. confluent hypodensity in the central pons likely represents additional sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease, given the such findings in other typical locations. however, possiblity of osmotic myelinolysis ("central pontine myelinolysis") cannot be excluded entirely, in the appropriate clinical context. 4. tiny, 2 mm aneurysm arising from the proximal portion of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery. 5. unremarkable cta of the neck. 6. prominence of superior ophthalmic veins in both orbits, likely varices. 7. severe emphysematous changes in the visualized lung apices with ill-defined nodular opacities in the right upper lobe. comparison with previous (outside) cross-sectional studies, if available, is advised.
