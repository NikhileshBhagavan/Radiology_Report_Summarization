1. no fracture or malalignment is identified. 2. the previously noted dense material within the spinal canal at the c3-4 and c4-5 levels may represent hypertrophied ligamentous tissue. this is difficult to discern on ct secondary to significant associated beam-hardening artifact. while hemorrhage cannot be entirely excluded, on limited evaluations of intraspinal canal tissues, this is not significantly changed to the prior ct scan from the same day. these results were discussed with dr. ___ ___ at 10:00 p.m. on ___.
1. no fracture or malalignment. 2. loss of normal cervical lordosis. 3. multilevel relatively mild-to-moderate degenerative change in the cervical spine. 4. multiple right-sided thyroid nodules can be assesed by non-emergent thyroid ultrasound. findings posted to the ed dashboard.

no evidence of fracture or dislocation. loss of the normal cervical lordosis.
multilevel degenerative changes as described above. no evidence of cord compression.
no acute fracture or dislocation. extensive degenerative change, most prominent at the levels of c3-c4 and c4-c5, with moderate-to-severe central canal stenosis at these levels. this predisposes the patient to risk for spinal cord injury in the setting of trauma, and mr can be obtained as clinically indicated.
no c-spine fracture.
1. no acute fracture or malalignment. 2. multilevel degenerative changes resulting in mild spinal canal stenosis at c5-c6 and c6-c7 level. 3. atherosclerotic vascular calcifications. findings posted on the ed dashboard.
1. acute fracture of the dens (type 2) with posterior translation of the anterior arch of c1 into the fracture line. there is significant post- fracture hematoma. posterior subluxation is present of c1 on c2. this is an unstable fracture and cervical stabilization is necessary as discussed with dr. ___ at 10:40 p.m. on the date of exam. mri without gadolinium is recommended as well as neurosurgical consultation. 2. degenerative changes as previously described. 3. vascular calcifications.
no fracture or listhesis.

no acute fracture or malalignment. dr. ___ ___ communicated the above results to dr. ___ ___ at 12:10 a.m. on ___ in person.
1. status post c3-c6 laminectomies, with a small area of paraspinal hypodensity and subtle enhancement noted in the left paraspinal region adjacent to c5 vertebral body, may represent a developing phlegmon. no epidural abscess is seen in the study. an mri with contrast can be obtained for further assessment. 2. multilevel degenerative changes of the cervical spine, with bilateral neural foraminal narrowing, worse at c3-c4. findings discussed with dr.___ at 7:30 p.m on ___.

1. no evidence for acute injury to the cervical spine. severe scoliosis and degenerative changes, stable. however, in the setting of trauma, these may predispose to cord injury. an mri would be recommended if there is concern for injury to the cervical spine. 2. left thyroid nodule. an ultrasound could be performed on a non-emergent basis for further evaluation.

1. new t11 compression fracture. otherwise stable appearance of multiple thoracic compression fractures. 2. marked bony demineralization. 2. similar right-sided pleural effusion with adjacent parenchymal opacity, which could represent residual atelectasis and/or consolidation. 3. stable linear opacities at the left apex, most likely due to prior scarring. however, comparison with prior ct imaging if available, or alternatively, follow-up ct could be helpful to ensure stability of the appearance. 5. multiple rib and transverse process fractures, with interval callus formation and fused to varying degrees. an email regarding the major findings and recommendations was sent to dr. ___ on ___.
