hyperdense, enhancing "extra-axial" intraventricular lesion, caudal to the obex of the ivth ventricle, at the level of the cervicomedullary junction, without evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus or subarachnoid spread ("seeding") at this time. the differential diagnosis is quite broad, but given the appearance, favors ependymoma or subependymoma, which may occur within the medulla or cervical spinal cord; astrocytoma is another consideration. choroid plexus is not present at this site, making papilloma unlikely, and though pnet has been rarely reported in older adults (and would be hypercellular and hyperdense, pre- contrast), the index lesion appears truly intraventricular, which would be unusual. meningioma occurs at the foramen magnum, but an intraventricular form at this site would be distinctly unusual, as would metastasis. enhanced mr has been recommended for further characterization, and findings were discussed with dr. ___ (neurosurgery service) at time of dictation.

1. near total resolution of the subdural hemorrhage along the interhemispheric fissure. 2. redistribution and evolution of the blood along the left frontoparietal convexity, with stable minimal rightward shift of septum pellucidum.
1. no intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. 2. persistent total soft tissue opacification of the right mastoid air cells. correlation with thorough neurological evaluation is advised, as two consecutive short-interval ct examinations for similar symptomatology have not yielded clinically relevant information.
1. extensive right subdural hematoma with 1 cm leftward midline shift of the septum pellucidum. subfalcine and transtentorial herniation noted. 2. nondisplaced acute longitudinal fracture extending through the left temporal bone, to involve the occipital bone. fracture line extends into the left sphenoid sinus and carotid canal. recommend clinical correlation for potential injury to the seventh cranial nerves in the mastoid portion. cta of the head is recommended to exclude injury to the left carotid artery. findings relayed to the emergency room dashboard shortly after the study was performed.
1. findings consistent with continued evolution of infarct in the left temporal region. 2. in addition, there is new loss of ___-white matter differentiation and hypodensity along the left occipital lobe indicating cytotoxic edema related to interval acute infarction in the left pca territory; no "hyperdense pca" is seen. 3. no new intracranial hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures seen.
focal hypodensities in right parietal and left cerebellar hemispheres are new since ___ exam, and may represent areas of infarction or infectious focus. correlate with mri head without and with contrast if not ci. findings discussed with dr. ___ by dr.___ at 2:11 p.m. on ___ by phone at the time of discovery.
stable examination. no new hemorrhage or hydrocephalus identified. unchanged right frontal subdural collection.
1. tiny focus of hypodensity, subcentimeter in size in the right frontal ___-white matter junction which was not previously visualized and should be considered a possible site for septic embolus if the concern is high; followup mri should be considered for further characterization. 2. mild mucosal thickening in the visualized paranasal sinuses.
study limited by patient motion; however, no definite evidence of new intracranial hemorrhage. slight interval decrease in previously seen pneumocephalus. interval evolution of small right-sided postoperative subdural.
no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. small left basal ganglia lacune. please refer to mri performed later the same day for more detail.
1. increasing hypodensity in the right temporal and right parietal lobes at the site of prior contusions, likely representative of evolution of contusive injury. however, differential also includes vasospasm causing a focal region of infarction, though there was no evidence for vasospasm on prior cta of the head. further evaluation with dedicated mri/mra may be warranted. 2. apparent slight improvement in subarachnoid hemorrhage. stable appearance to right temporoparietal hemorrhagic contusions. 3. small volume of hemorrhage in the left occipital ___, which is more apparent on this study compared to priors. 4. no hydrocephalus, shift of midline structures or herniation.
1. no acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. correlate with repeat lp if necessary. 2. patent major intracranial arteries as described above, without obvious aneurysm more than 3 mm within the resolution of ct angiogram. contour irregularity of the vertebral arteries/proximal basilar is noted, likely related to the course of the vertebral arteries close to ___. minimal focal prominence of the right posterior communicating artery and confluence of acom and left a2 segments. 3. small, 1.3x1.0cm, dural-based enhancing lesion in the right meckel's cave extending to the cp angle region. f/u with mr if not ci. please see the subsequently performed conventional angiogram study for other details.
1. stable appearance to right thalamic bleed. 2. decreased intraventricular hemorrhage with stable ventricular size. 3. stable appearance to subarachnoid hemorrhage.
multiple foci of parenchymal hemorrhage as well as small amount of likely subarachnoid hemorrhage. the location of some of these foci at the ___-white matter interface is concerning for diffuse axonal injury. please note that mri with gradient echo sequences may be more sensitive for full characterization of traumatic injury.
1. no acute intracranial abnormality. 2. periventricular white matter hypodense areas most likely represent chronic small vessel ischemic disease. however, given the lack of prior studies available for comparison, a small focus of acute ischemia cannot be excluded. mri can be considered for further evaluation if there is clinical concern for acute infarction, if not contra-indicated.
