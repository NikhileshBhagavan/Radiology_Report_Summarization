slight tilting of the patient's head during imaging limits evaluation for symmetry somewhat. allowing for this, no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, hydrocephalus, or large vascular territory infarction is seen. study is also limited due to patient motion, particularly the imaging through the skull base. again prominence of the sulci and ventricles is consistent with age-related involutional change. periventricular white matter hypodensities are likely due to chronic small vessel ischemic disease. note is also made of likely chronic small lacunar infarcts in bilateral basal ganglia. the soft tissues, orbits, and skull appear intact. the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are normally aerated. vascular calcifications are noted along the cavernous carotid arteries.

the patient is status post external ventricular drain via a right frontal burr hole which is unchanged in position from ___ with decreased size of the ventricles since the most recent prior study performed 21 hours earlier, now measuring 30 mm across the lateral ventricles (previously 37 mm). subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage is again seen layering within the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles bilaterally. small right pneumocephalus is decreased in size from ___ secondary to evd placement. there is a new focus of hemorrhage measuring roughly 27 x 25 mm along the superior track of the evd with no associated mass effect or edema involving the adjacent right frontal lobe. extensive bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage is again seen in the suprasellar cistern, basal cistern, cerebellopontine angles and extending inferiorly into the foramen magnum with evidence of redistribution from ___ but overall unchanged in extent. a subdural component seen along the falx cerebri posteriorly on ___ is significantly increased, now with bilateral subdural hematomas extending along the posterior convexity of the cerebral hemispheres bilaterally measuring up to 8 mm in thickness on the left (3:25), and layering along the tentorium. there has been interval placement of coil material in the left pca/pcom aneurysm of the most recent prior study with associated streak artifact limiting evaluation of adjacent structures. there is persistent overall loss of ___-white matter differentiation consistent with diffuse cerebral edema. there is no evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarct. there is no shift of normally midline structures. the visualized orbits and mastoid air cells are unremarkable. partial opacification of the bilateral ethmoid air cells and an air-fluid level in the right sphenoid sinus is noted. mild mucosal thickening is seen in the left sphenoid sinus and bilateral maxillary sinuses.

in the inferior aspect of the right temporal lobe (2:10) is a new hypodense region which extends to the cortex. an additional region of hypodensity in the right parietal lobe (2:16) also extends to the cortex. these two regions likely represent evolution of prior hemorrhagic contusions. there are stable hyperdense foci (2:15 and 2:11) likely representing persistence of prior sites of contusion injury. there are no new foci of hemorrhage. there is slight improvement in appearance of right-sided subarachnoid hemorrhage, and the right frontal subdural hematoma is less evident on this current study. hyperdense material layers in the left lateral ventricular occipital ___ (2:18), representing intraventricular extension of hemorrhage, more apparent on the current study than on previous examinations. ventricles and sulci appear unchanged in size without evidence for hydrocephalus. there is no shift of normally-midline structures. basilar cisterns are widely patent and there is no sign of herniation. osseous structures appear intact. there are persistent air-fluid levels in the right maxillary and bilateral sphenoid sinuses. ethmoid air cells demonstrate mild mucosal thickening. fluid partially opacifies the left mastoid air cells.
ct head without contrast: there is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus. the ventricles and extra-axial csf spaces are normal. a small hypodense focus is noted in the right sublentiform location, series 2, image 13, measuring approximately 5 x 4 mm and represents a small cyst or perivascular space. a small extra-axial dural-based lesion is noted in the region of the right meckel's cave, extending posteriorly to the right cp angle region, mild indentation on the right side of the pons, measuring approximately 1.3 x 1.0 cm, minimally increased in size since the prior mr head of ___. no suspicious osseous lesions are noted. minimal mucosal thickening is noted in the ethmoid air cells. the mastoid air cells are clear.
there is grossly unchanged appearance to hemorrhage of the right thalamus and posterior limnb,internal capsule with transependymal dissection of blood into the ventricular system. there is decreased volume of hemorrhage layering in both occipital horns compared to the prior study. ventricular size is unchanged since the prior study. subarachnoid hemorrhage is present particularly in bilateral sylvian fissures and in the posterior fossa but this appears stable since the previous examination. periventricular white matter hypodensities are present but stable and likely the sequela of chronic small vessel chronic small vessel infarct. vascular calcifications are noted in bilateral vertebral, carotids and bilateral mcas, stable. no areas concerning for acute infarct. osseous structures appear intact. there is minimal mucosal thickening of the right sphenoid sinus. remaining paranasal sinuses, ethmoidal and mastoid air cells are clear.
there are multiple bilateral small foci of parenchymal hemorrhage with a reference focus seen in the right parietal lobe at the ___-white matter interface (2:27). the largest focus of parenchymal hemorrhage is 10 x 5mm in the left frontal lobe. scattered areas of peripheral hyperdensity include a small focus over the left parietal lobe and right frontal lobe, concerning for subarachnoid blood. ___-white matter differentiation is preserved. there is no mass effect or vascular territorial infarction. the ventricles and sulci are normal in size and in configuration. soft tissue swelling is noted over the frontal bone on the left. there is no fracture. the mastoid air cells are clear. fluid layers dependently in the nasopharynx. there is a small mucus retention cyst posteriorly in the sphenoid sinus.
there is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, major vascular territory infarction, mass effect, or edema. ___-white matter differentiation is preserved. periventricular white matter hypodense areas likely relate to chronic small vessel ischemic disease; however, given the lack of prior studies available for comparison, a small focus of acute ischemia cannot be excluded. age-appropriate prominence of ventricles and sulci is consistent with diffuse parenchymal volume loss. the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated. no osseous abnormality is identified.
