1. no evidence of pulmonary embolus. 2. severe emphysematous changes.
1. bilateral moderate pleural effusions, likely malignant effusions. 2. 5-mm right middle lobe nodule and prominent intrathoracic lymph nodes. 2. large right lobe hepatic metastasis and innumerable nodal metastases in the porta hepatis, mesentery, and retroperitoneum.
1. no evidence of pulmonary embolism. limited evaluation for subsegmental branchies in the lower lobes due to motion. atherosclerotic and tortuous aorta with calcified and noncalcified plaques, however, no evidence of dissection. 2. centrilobular emphysema. 3. peribronchial thickening in bilateral lower lobes, with increased patchy opacities in the right lower lobe, worrisome for infectious or inflammatory process in this area. please note that subclavian arteries are not visualized on post-contrast study on this study.
1. long type a aortic dissection with a small hemopericardium. rca, lad, and lcx remain opacified. dissection extends through the common iliac arteries and into the proximal left and right internal iliac arteries and mid right external iliac artery. 2. complete infarction of the right kidney and spleen. small amount of clot in the proximal left renal artery although the left kidney remains normally perfused. 3. liver remains perfused but the blood supply in the celiac trunk appears tenuous. blood supply in the proximal superior mesenteric artery is also tenuous although good flow is seen distally. inferior mesenteric artery remains normally opacified. findings were discussed with dr. ___ ___, vascular fellow, at 4 pm on ___, via telephone by dr. ___ ___.
1. no evidence of pulmonary embolism. 2. diffuse bilateral areas of patchy parenchymal and ground glass opacity (left greater than right) a nonspecific finding that could represent an infectious or inflammatory process. no areas of pulmonary parenchymal consolidation are seen. 3. small bilateral pleural effusions (right greater than left). 4. mild pulmonary edema.
no pulmonary embolism. moderate right pleural effusion with associated compressive atelectasis of the dependent portion of the right lower lobe. small left pleural effusion. scattered opacities in bilateral lung parenchyma with bronchial thickening. this is most likely related to an infectious and atypical ___ such as mycobacterium, including ___ should be considered in the differential.
1) unchanged appearance of the transplant liver as discussed previously with patent hepatic vasculature. 2) improvement in the multifocal patchy and ground-glass opacities in the bilateral lungs with persistent depending consolidations. 3) slight interval increase in amount of fluid in the left upper quadrant and in the pelvis compared to the ___ study.
1. ascending aortic aneurysm complicated by a penetrating ulcer arising 4 cm from the aortic valve. this ulcer is wide-mouthed with a 2.5 cm intimal gap seen. intramural hematoma extending along this pseudoaneurysm proximally but not reaching the origin of the great vessels. 2. cardiomegaly with marked enlargement of the right atrium suggests tricuspid valve disease. 3. large bilateral pleural effusions. 4. dual-lead pacemaker in situ. dr. ___ discussed the findings with dr. ___ ___ by telephone at 2:20 p.m., ___.
1. diffuse bilateral peribronchovascular ground-glass opacity more likely represent edema than infection. moderate left greater than right pleural effusions. 2. anasarca with mild ascites and mesenteric edema diffusely. 3. hypodense splenic and hepatic lesions of unclear etiology or chronicity without priors. 4. secretions in trachea near carina raise risk of aspiration.
1. no evidence of pulmonary embolism. 2. continuing interval growth of central mediastinal lymphadenopathy that could be related to lymphoproliferative reaction, inflammatory conditions with metastasis thought much less likely though not entirely excluded. 3. interval development of patchy opacification within the lower lobes. given rapid increase superimposed infection and/or aspiration is suspected. there may also be a background of radiation change and copd. 4. severe emphysema.
1. unchanged appearance of left lower lobe collapse. 2. no evidence of pulmonary embolism. 3. unchanged appearance of wedge shaped right lower lobe opacity, which enhances post-contrast. this may represent a postobstructive process due to mucus plugging. 4. unchanged small left pleural effusion. 5. unchanged coronary artery calcifications.
1. no dissection or pulmonary embolism is identified. there is a stable small saccular aneurysm along the inferior aspect of the descending aortic arch. 2. new small regions of subpleural ground-glass opacity in the right upper lobe. appearance is nonspecific. 3. small bilateral pleural effusions left greater than right, new compared to the previous examination.
1. stable appearance to mediastinal, perigastric, and mesenteric lymph nodes compared to prior exam of ___, which do not meet ct criteria for pathologic enlargement. however, the increased total number of lymph nodes identified is somewhat atypical, the significance of which is unclear. 2. small to moderate sized hiatal hernia.
