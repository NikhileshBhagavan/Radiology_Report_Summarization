small osseous fragments at the right inferior anterior corner of the c1 lateral mass as well as within the c1-c2 joint space on the right as well. while atypical for acute injury, it is difficult, particularly in light of no prior comparison studies, to exclude small avulsion or impaction type fractures. additionally, the subluxation at c5-c6 is most likely due to degenerative disease and facet degeneration; however, again without comparison studies, this is difficult to confirm. reportedly, the patient would likely be unable to cooperate with flexion and extension radiographs and would be difficult to obtain an adequate neurological exam. in such case, an mri is likely indicated to assess for underlying injury and to confirm ligamentous integrity. the findings were reviewed with dr. ___, trauma surgery, at approximately 12:30 hours on the day of study.
