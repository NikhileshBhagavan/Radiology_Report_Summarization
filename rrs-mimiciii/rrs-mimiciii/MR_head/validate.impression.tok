small hyperintensity seen only on the diffusion-weighted sequence which is too small to fully characterize. this may represent artifact but a tiny acute infarct cannot be excluded. if neurologic abnormalities are referred to this area, followup study could be performed for further evaluation.
1. postoperative changes in the form of right frontal, parietal, and temporal craniotomy with resection cavity in the right temporal lobe. extra-axial fluid collection along the right frontal and parietal convexity which has mildly decreased in size as compared to the prior study. 2. two new nodular enhancing foci posterior and posteromedial to the resection cavity. these are concerning for disease progression. however possibility of treatent related changes cannot be entirely ruled out. 3. the enhancing focus in the right frontal lobe has decreased in size as compared to the prior study. 4. no evidence of acute infarct. these findings were communicated by critical radiological imaging dashboard.
extensive edema in the left frontal lobe extending to the corpus callosum with rim-enhancing masses as described above. the lack of slow diffusion suggest masses to be due to neoplasms. although the masses are in the same lobe with some involvement of the corpus callosum, the appearances are more typical a metastatic disease than a primary neoplasms such as glioma.
1. acute bilateral cerebellar infarcts. 2. subacute bilateral occipital lobes and left temporal lobe infarct. 3. small right vertebral artery without signal within it. it is unclear whether this represents a thrombosed vertebral artery, a small vertebral artery that is too small to demonstrate blood flow or a reversal of flow in this vessel. if indicated, additional evaluation of cta could be performed.
1. persistent small area of nodular enhancement in the left cerebellar hemispheric surgical resection cavity which may represent postsurgical changes versus tumor. needs attention on close followup. however, there is some decrease in the enhancement noted in the surgical resection cavity compared to prior which can relate to post-surgical changes. 2. new, 0.5 x 0.4 cm enhancing lesion in the left frontal vertex, dural- based, represents a new metastatic lesion. attention on close followup is recommended if no intervention is contemplated. findings were informed to dr. ___ ___ by dr.___ on ___ .

1. a large mass measuring 3.2-cm in greatest dimension is present within the left posterior parasagittal parietal lobe. the mass is complex in its signal characteristics demonstrating peripheral irregular enhancement with central non-enhancement as well as peripheral slow diffusion. tumor is felt most likely with central necrosis, although typically, central necrosis has homogeneous t2 hyperintensity centrally whereas this lesion demonstrates t2 isointensity. a complex hemorrhage is a possibility, although the ct obtained at outside institution demonstrates that this mass is not hyperdense, in a patient with anemia, it is possible that the density may be diminished. possibly, both may be the case, a tumor with complex hemorrhage. abscess is considered less likely given that centrally the lesion is hypointense on diffusion with peripheral slow diffusion. 2. multifocal confluent and flair hyperintensities are present within the periventricular and subcortical white matter without restricted diffusion or gradient signal artifact likely representing the sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
1. unchanged appearance of nodular enhancement along the right frontal surgical cavity margins, most of which has persistent slow diffusion. lack of resolution of slow diffusion suggests that these findings represent persistent tumor rather than ischemia. a small nodular enhancing focus along the inferior anterior aspect of the surgical cavity is unchanged in size without evidence of slow diffusion, suggestive of persistent tumor. 2. new punctate enhancing focus with associated high t2 signal in the left frontal deep white matter, concerning for a new metastasis. 3. near complete resolution of vasogenic edema in the right frontal lobe. persistent, though decreased, leftward shift of the septum pellucidum, probably in part related to interval enlargement of the right subdural collection, which is now moderate. 4. persistent, slightly decreased, small right frontal epidural fluid collection. 5. slightly increased bifrontal, left greater than right, subgaleal fluid collection. 6. fluid in the maxillary sinuses, which may indicate acute sinusitis. dfdkq
small isointense t1 and hypointense t2 left tentorial lesion most consistent with a meningioma based on signal intensity values. the location and morphology would be less typical for a hemorrhage. if a more definitive diagnosis is needed, a repeat limited mri with axial t1, gradient echo and t2 images may be obtained in one week to assess for change in the appearance of the lesion, that would typically be seen with a hemorrhage, but not a meningioma. these findings were discussed with dr. ___ on date of the examination at approximately 4 p.m.

persistent right frontal subacute intra-axial hematoma with mild surrounding edema. the overall size of the hematoma has decreased since the prior study. the hematoma measures now 3.3 cm x 2.0 cm. patient, however, needs followup examination with post-gadolinium images as an underlying lesion cannot be excluded because gadolinium was not able to be administered as the patient could not finish the examination.
there is slightly increased enhancement along the left tentorium which could still be within the spectrum of post-operative change but would recommend attention on short term followup imaging to exclude recurrence.
again identified are multiple brain metastatic lesions. some of the lesions have slightly increased in size compared to the prior mri of ___ as described above. no significant brain edema is identified.

multiple infarcts are identified in both cerebral hemispheres involving right frontal, parietal and occipital lobes and left occipital and parietal lobes. the largest infarct is seen in the distribution of right anterior cerebral artery. in this infarct, susceptibility abnormalities due to blood products are seen. no midline shift noted. chronic watershed infarcts in the right cerebral hemisphere are again noted.
status post left occipital craniotomy. resection of the previously demonstrated infiltrative mass lesion on the left cerebellar hemisphere. residual pattern of enhancement in the surgical bed with a nodular area of enhancement as described above, measuring approximately 19 x 9 mm in size possibly related with volume averaging, persistent edema in the posterior fossa involving the left cerebellar hemisphere. unchanged microvascular ischemic disease in the periventricular white matter. small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage. blood products identified in the surgical bed. followup mri is recommended to demonstrate any further change or stability in the pattern of enhancement in the surgical area.

1. increased thickness and nodularity of the enhancing rind surrounding the resection cavity. additionally, there is increased flair-signal abnormality around the resection cavity without corresponding slow diffusion. while these imaging findings are suggestive of true progression of tumor, the stable clinical status of the patient (established in discussion with dr. ___, suggests that these findings may represent so-called "pseudoprogression" related to combined temodar and radiotherapy. "advanced" imaging with dedicated perfusion sequences and mr spectroscopy could be performed in an attempt to distinguish these entities. 2. decreased right frontal extra-axial fluid collection.
1. recanalization of the a2 aneurysm, with the current hyperintense outpouching grossly resembling the pre-coiled appearance. 2. multifocal intracranial vasospasm as described. 3. expected evolution of the corpus callosal infarct and right frontal hemorrhage. the attending neuroradiologist, dr. ___ ___, has discussed the urgent findings in detail with the neurosurgery attending, dr. ___ ___, at 4:14 p.m. on ___.

1. slightly increased extend of high t2 signal involving the left frontal and parietal white matter, and also the right occipital parasagittal cortex and subcortical white matter. while this could represent post-treatment changes, ___ progression in the right occipital lobe cannot be excluded, and close attention to this area is recommended on follow-up. 2. the peripheral enhancement along the left parietal resection cavity remains stable, apart from new central necrosis of a small enhancing nodule along the superior margin of the resection cavity. this could represent posttreatment change.
mild-to-moderate brain atrophy without evidence of medial temporal atrophy. no enhancing mass lesion, midline shift or hydrocephalus.
incomplete examination insufficient to provide any diagnostic information. consider repeating the study when feasible.
1. irregular rim-enhancing mass centered within the left thalamus with inferior extension into the brainstem. the imaging characteristics including inferior extension favor a glioblastoma multiforme. less likely in the differential are metastasis, lymphoma and pnet. of note, it has been shown that slow diffusion within the enhancing portion of a glioblastoma multiforme, as in this case, is associated with an aggressive behavior.
redemonstration of the lesion in the region of the posterior planum sphenoidale/superior to the tuberculum sella as described above for surgical mapping.
persistent large extra-axial collection in the prepontine cistern with associated focal pachymeningeal, superficial pontine leptomeningeal and cranial nerve enhancement. this may represent development of "sterile" meningitis, related to the known presence of merocel glue particles at this site. however, given that this collection appears to communicate with the ___, which, itself, contains increased amount of enhancing material and, ultimately, with the sphenoid sinus, superinfection cannot be entirely excluded.
1. post-surgical changes in the right frontal lobe with blood products. assessment for any residual tumor is limited on the present study. follow up closely to assess for interval change. 2. persistent moderate surrounding edema with mild leftward shift of midline structures and mass effect on the right lateral ventricle.

1. stable appearance of the subdural hemorrhage in the posterior fossa. no new extra-axial collection is identified. 2. t1 hyperintense focus in the left cerebellum. given the intrinsic t1 hyperintensity, it is difficult to assess the enhancing characteristics of this lesion. however, it is overall stable since the prior examinations. 3. multiple foci of susceptibility artifact in the infra- and supra- tentorium, consistent with micro bleeds. this is stable in appearance since the most recent prior. while it does appear to be markedly decreased compared to older prior studies, this may be related to differences in technique given that all the other prior imaging was performed at 3 tesla compared to the current and most recent prior study which were both performed at 1.5 tesla mri. if this is of clinical concern, followup imaging can be performed on a 3 tesla mri scanner may help clarify this difference.
1. the left posterior parietal lobe, there is an arteriovenous malformation in the region of enhancement described on the earlier ct scan. there is no evidence of hemorrhage of this malformation. 2. there are two areas of faintly increased signal on the axial flair images in the posterior fronto-superior cortex bilaterally, which is not seen on other sequences and is of uncertain significance. this may represent cortical edema related to recent seizure activity, though there is no definite way to confirm this. if clinically indicated, followup evaluation can be obtained.

right periventricular hemorrhage along the margin of the atrium of the right lateral ventricle with extension to the lateral ventricles. no definite evidence of abnormal enhancement to indicate underlying mass. a follow-up examination, however, is indicated in 8 to 12 weeks to exclude an underlying abnormality. no other areas of abnormal enhancement seen. old pontine infarcts. soft tissue changes in the paranasal sinuses more pronounced in the maxillary sinuses.
there has been some progression of the medial component of the left temporal tumor, as described. there are also two small nodules of enhancement identified, which may represent sites of neoplastic involvement. further follow up is recommended.
no change in the right frontal infarct compared to the previous study on diffusion-weighted images.

1. stable appearance of signal abnormality in the brainstem with interval decreased enhancement as also seen on the same day cervical spine mri study. the differential diagnoses are the same as previously mentioned and include subacute infarct, demyelinating disease, reaction to radiation therapy, as well as metastatic disease. 2. small vessel ischemic disease.
1. scattered foci of susceptibility and slow diffusion seen in the left frontal white matter and left parietal lobe suggest an element of diffuse axonal injury/ ___ injury, though these are not very extensive and diffuse. 2. unchanged appearance of small bilateral epidural hematomas. subdural tentorial blood is not visualized likely secondary to imaging plane. 3. diffuse edema of the left cerebral hemisphere, better appreciated on the recent ct head.
1. limited and incomplete study due to motion artifact. multiple bilateral flair hyperintensities that could represent press given the patient's history and pattern of distribution. a repeat study with gadolinium is recommended when feasible. 2. very limited mra of the circle of ___ demonstrated questionable right mca stenosis and poor visualization of the basilar artery. 3. cannot evaluate for metastatic disease to the brain. the findings and recommendations were discussed with dr. ___ at the time of the dictation.
1. stable postoperative changes in the right frontal lobe with persistent surrounding flair hyperintensity, and no significant change in surrounding enhancement allowing for difference in technique. it likely represents residual neoplasm. continue followup is recommended. 2. focus of enhancement in the right temporal region is similar to the prior examination. this is of unknown etiology, but differential again includes neoplasm.
no evidence of territorial infarct or metastatic disease; mild small vessel ischemic disease and atrophy.
1. interval development of slowed diffusion within the left posterior frontal lobe consistent with acute infarct. 2. evaluation of the sylvian and distal branches of the cerebral vasculature is limited, however, no occlusion of the central branches of the anterior or posterior circulation are identified. 3. encephalomalacia within the right posterofrontal lobe at the site of patient's prior infarct. an area of hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted imaging at this location with central hypodensity likely relates to susceptibility artifact. dfdgf
1. new 6 mm enhancing nodule with hyperperfusion posterior and lateral to the left thalamus, adjacent to the preexisting ehnancing tumor, suggesting tumor progression. 2. other components of the preexisting enhancing tumor have decreased in size.
1. no evidence of intracranial mass, infarction, or infectious process. 2. acute-on-chronic inflammatory disease in the left sphenoid air cell; correlate clinically.
1. no areas of abnormal enhancement to suggest intracranial metastatic spread. 2. stable appearance of small punctate area of susceptibility artifact in the right cerebellum, of unclear clinical significance, showing no change from the previous examination. 3. enlarged lymph nodes identified in the anterior neck.
the enhancing portion of the mass in the right posterior temporal lobe has decreased. however, the extent of the t2 signal abnormality is unchanged. there is subependymal enhancement indicating subependymal tumor spread as before. interval development of a cystic area adjacent to the right frontal ventriculostomy catheter with rim enhancement. as discussed above, this finding is most consistent with an area of developing brain necrosis due to the chemotherapeutic agents. ___ ___ was e-mailed these findings at the time of the dictation. dr. ___ ___ ___
1. no evidence of intracranial tumor progression. rather, a small left occipital enhancing nodule seen previously shows near-total resolution and there is no further evidence of enhancement surrounding the left occipital resection cavity. a small enhancing nodule in the right frontal lobe is unchanged. 2. 3-cm subcutaneous nodule overlying the occiput as above. this is increased dramatically from 1.6 cm in the comparison study and is nonspecific, but given the history of systemic malignancy, metastatic disease is not excluded. recommend correlation to direct examination and/or ultrasound to further characterize this lesion. results and recommendations for followup are entered into the critical results communication tool on ___ at 16:02.
1. assymetric enhancement along the anterior aspect of the right cavernous sinus extending to the orbital apex. while this finding may be secondary to head canting or patient positioning,if this finding is real; the differential diagnosis also includes the following: ___-hunt; sarcoid; fungal infections; and neoplasms such as lymphoma and meningioma. 2. minimal sinus disease as described above, the activity of which is to be determined clinically.
1. stable post-surgical changes in the posterior fossa, with a mass lesion at the dorsal aspect of the medulla, which demonstrates t2 hyperintensity and diffuse enhancement, which appears to slowly be progressing when compared to earlier studies dating back to ___, given that it enhances more diffusely and has slowly increased in size. this is concerning for residual/recurrent neoplasm with post radiation-induced changes considered less likely. 2. no evidence of an acute infarct. old lacunar infarct in the left thalamus as well as atrophy of the left cerebellar hemisphere is stable since the prior study. 3. stable areas of white matter signal abnormality which may represent the sequela of prior treatment. 4. stable appearance of the vasculature of the head, with complete occlusion of the left posterior cerebral artery.
1. approximately 2 x 2 cm right temporal lobe intraparenchymal hematoma with surrounding fluid collection, which may represent edema and/or serum-like exudate from the adjacent hematoma. 2. multiple focal old lacunar infarcts in the frontal and parietal lobes, the pons, and the cerebellum. these findings, along with the intraparenchymal hemorrhage are concerning for an embolic cause or an underlying vasculitis. these findings were discussed with the neurology team on ___.
wand study again demonstrates a right frontal lobe irregular rim-enhancing lesion as described previously.
