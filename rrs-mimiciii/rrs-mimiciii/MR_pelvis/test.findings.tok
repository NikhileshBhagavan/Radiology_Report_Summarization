status post radical hysterectomy. there is susceptibility artifact on the left, lying between the bladder and the rectum -- are there surgical clips in this location? adjacent to the artifact, there is an ill-defined 16 x 29 mm area of abnormal soft tissue intensity, hypointense on t1 with intermediate intensity on t2. no discrete mass is seen. no enlarge pelvic lymph nodes are detected. the bladder wall is not thickened. a small amount of free fluid is present within the pelvis. there is is left hydroureter, with dilatation of the renal pelvis and prominence of the calyces. the hydroureter extends down to the area of the susceptibility artifact and the adjoining area of abnormal soft tissue intensity. the right renal collecting system is within normal limits. comparison was made to ct dated ___. the area of soft tissue intensity corresponds to some ill-defined stranding seen at that time. however, no hydronephrosis was seen on the ___ ct scan.
there is a large mass in the right hemipelvis. this mass measures approximately 7 x 6 x 7 cm (ap x lateral lateral x craniocaudal) in size. the mass is just medial to the right iliac muscle. another component is demonstrated in the posterior right hemipelvis measuring approximately 6 x 7 x 5.5 cm (ap x lateral lateral x craniocaudal) in size. this mass appears to be an extension from the mass in the right anterior hemipelvis. the posterior component of the mass is growing and extending into the right sacrum and is involving the foramen for the s1 nerve root. after gadolinium administration, the mass demonstrates heterogeneous enhancement with central areas of poor enhancement consistent with necrosis. the described mass is encasing the right iliac vessels. there is a filling defect in the right iliac vein and right common femoral vein consistent with thrombosis. this thrombus is extending from the level of the bifurcation to the level of the femoral head. the proximal right lower extremity was not evaluated in this study. there is diffuse wall thickening in several loops of small bowel as well as the sigmoid colon probably related to the previous history of radiotherapy. a colostomy is noted in the left lower quadrant. an ileostomy is also demonstrated in the left lower quadrant. the anterior component of the described mass is compressing the loop of small bowel at the level of the ileostomy as well as the distal ureters. there is significant right-sided hydronephrosis. the left kidney is not hydronephrotic. multiple surgical clips are demonstrated at both sides of the pelvis. another susceptibility artifact is noted on the left side in the region of the lower pelvis consistent with a local radiotherapy implant. in conclusion there is a large mass in the right hemipelvis encasing the distal ileostomy and distal ureters. the mass is also involving the right sacral ___. the described findings are consistent with recurrent bladder tumor.
there is a small well-defined fluid collection in the anterior aspect of the upper pelvis which measures 4.3 x 1.1 cm, just posterior to the left rectus muscle. signal characteristics are consistent with hematoma. there is a tiny amount of free fluid within the pelvis. the left ovary measures 2.4 x 2.8 cm and contains a 1 cm probable corpus luteum cyst. the right ovary is 1.4 x 1.2 cm. patient is known to be 6 weeks pregnant.
there is no free pelvic fluid. the right ovary is normal. the left ovary is not definitively visualized. compared with ___, there is new thickening of the left posterolateral aspect of the bladder wall without abnormal enhancement. the susceptibility artifact in the left pelvis is unchanged and corresponds to surgical clips seen on radiographs. there is no pelvic adenopathy or abnormal soft tissue masses in the pelvic side walls. no masses are seen around the vagina. there is no change of a small area in the superior aspect of the left ischiorectal fossa which is t1 hyperintense and shows hypointense stranding on t2 weighted images; this area does not enhance and likely represents a post-surgical scar.
there is no evidence of thrombi within the deep veins in the pelvis. the flow sensitive sequences demonstrate normal intensity in the veins and the administration of gadolinium confirms these findings. in the pelvis there is a relatively hyperintense lesion on t1 weighted sequences measuring 4.7 x 6.5 cm. it is adjacent to the uterus. another lesion is noted measuring 3.7 x 4.6 cm. it is less hyperintense than the prior lesion and is seen to the midline on the right. both lesions do not enhance following administration of gadolinium. there are hyperintense regions in the bone marrow in the pelvic bones on both sides measuring up to 1.6 cm in diameter. they are noted in the femoral heads, femoral neck and the ischium. in conclusion, no evidence of dvt. two pelvic masses were noted that might represent either adnexal masses or drop metastases from a known breast cancer. bone marrow lesions are also noted that can be attributed to the primary disease. further evaluation may be warranted by a pelvic ultrasound or a dedicated pelvic mr as this study was conducted mainly for evaluation of the patency of the veins.
the liver does not show focal masses or abnormalities. there is no dilatation of the intra or extrahepatic bile ducts. the pancreas, spleen, adrenals and kidneys appear within normal limits. at the level of l2-3 there are endplate changes with increased intensity on haste sequences with irregularity of the endplate and loss of height of the disc space. increase in signal is also noted bilaterally in the psoas muscles on t2-weighted images. on stir this area also has increased intensity in the disc space with continuity to the psoas muscles, bilaterally. focal fluid collection in the right psoas muscle should be regarded as an abscess. after administration of gadolinium there is marked early enhancement around the disc space and bilaterally in the psoas regions more evident on the right side. it extends from the disc space into the right psoas muscle for about 5 cm and on the left for about 7.8 cm but it is thinner measuring only 6 mm. on the right side it has central decreased intensity which is compatible with abscess. on the sagittal images it seems that there might be an extension to the epidural space but this cannot be fully confirmed.

the sacral nerve roots appear normal bilaterally and there are no masses or fluid collections along their courses. however, note is again made of asymmetry of the piriformus muscles, left greater than right. however, this asymmetry is less than seen on the prior ct of ___. the left piriformus muscle does contain abnormal high t2 signal diffusely, as do all of the visualized portions of the gluteus minimus, medius, and maximus muscles on the left. there is no abnormal t1 signal in these muscles to suggest hemorrhage or atrophy. again seen within the left gluteus medius muscle is an ovoid mass-like lesion measuring 4.5 x 6.6 cm. it is difficult to compare the size with the prior studies as this was not well seen on the prior ct and was only partially imaged in a different plane on the prior lumbar spine mri. this lesion is primarily of low t2 signal and intermediate t1 signal. note is made of several prominent linear signal voids wrapping around this lesion, consistent with dilated arterial branches. there are no bone marrow signal abnormalities. the visualized portion of the lumbosacral spinal canal appears unremarkable. sacroiliac joints are normal. limited assessmentof pelvic viscera are unremarkable.
pelvic viscera are unremarkable, specifically the bladder and the bladder, prostate and seminal vesicles are normal in appearance. the visualized colon demonstrates scattered diverticula without evidence of pericolonic inflammation. the visualized small bowel are unremarkable. there is no acute bony abnormality.
there has been interval removal of the two screws across the left si joints. ghost screw tracks remain and are filled with high t2 signal, enhancing material. the left si joint is widened, primarily due to destruction of the subchondral bone. this destruction is much more extensive than on the ct of ___. the destruction is greater on the sacral side than on the iliac side. there is extensive bone marrow edema and enhancement on both sides of the left sacroiliac joint, extending to the midline of the sacrum and throughout the medial aspect of the left iliac bone. edema and enhancement also extends out into the left gluteus minimus and medius muscles. edema and enhancement also extends superiorly and laterally from the left si joint between the left iliac ___ and the iliacus muscle. the right sacroiliac joint is also abnormal. there is a small amount of fluid within the joint and there is a mild degree of marrow edema and enhancement on both sides of the joint. no frank bony destruction is evident. a thin layer of edema and enhancement also extends superolaterally from the right si joint, between the iliac ___ and iliacus muscle. symmetric, linear signal abnormalities in both iliac crests likely represents tracks of prior pelvic fixator pins. pubic symphysis diastasis is unchanged. right superior pubic and inferior pubic rami fractures are again identified. these show some evidence of healing. colostomy in the left lower quadrant is again identified. internal pelvic viscera are otherwise unremarkable. no fluid collections are evident within or about the pelvis and hips.
the previously noted perirectal abscess in the deep posterior perianal space on the right is less prominent on today's examination. edema and thickening in the right levator ani muscle persists but is also less prominent. the rectum, prostate, seminal vesicles and bladder are unremarkable. the arterial supply of the pelvis is also unremarkable. bilateral anterior obturator lymph nodes measure 1.0 cm on the right and 0.8 cm on the left, in short axis. multiple bilateral benign-appearing inguinal lymph nodes are present. there are no acute bony abnormalities. diffuse edema within the subcutaneous tissues of the pelvis is present and slightly more prominent. also noted is a moderate amount of free fluid within the pelvis, without discernable etiology. the visualized bowel loops are unremarkable. a portion of this pelvic free fluid extends from the left paracolic gutter.
there is severe, extensive high t2 signal edema throughout many of the muscles of the pelvic girdle and upper thighs in a fairly symmetric pattern, but generally greater on the right. the hamstring muscles, obturator internis muscles, and gluteus maximus muscles are spared, but essentially all other muscles are involved. there is also extensive edema of the subcutaneous fat diffusely and there is some fluid tracking along fascial planes. there is a relatively large collection of fluid in a fascial plane posterior to the right greater trochanter, between the trochanter and the gluteus maximus muscle. after administration of gadolinium, there are multiple foci of lack of enhancement within muscles, presumably representing fluid collections. the largest of these is in the upper right anteromedial thigh, in the adductor longus muscle. this measures 2.7 x 2.1 cm in cross section and 6 cm in length. immediately adjacent to this is a much smaller fluid collection in the adductor brevis muscle. similar smaller collections are also seen in the upper right vastus lateralis, in the upper tensor fascia lata muscle on the right, in the most proximal portion of the right sartorius muscle, and in both gluteus minimus muscles. the pelvis has not been included in prior mri's but comparison of the upper thighs to prior studies shows edema and fluid collections that are more severe and more extensive than in any of the prior studies. there are no bone marrow signal abnormalities. hip joints, pubic symphysis, and sacroiliac joints are unremarkable. internal pelvic viscera are unremarkable.
there is a large amount of free fluid within the pelvis and abdomen. there is no localized fluid collection to suggest an abscess. the pelvic viscera are unremarkable. incidental note is made of edematous omentum, without nodularity or significant enhancement. there is enhancement of the peritoneum, which is smoothly marginated and without nodularity or irregularity. no acute bony abnormalities identified.

pelvic mri with contrast: the transplant kidney is swollen and edematous, increased in size, when compared to the previous examination, by 1-2 cm in both the ap and craniocaudal dimensions. prominent urothelial edema is seen within the renal hilum. the previously-noted perinephric stranding has been replaced by a thin-walled fluid collection, most likely representing an evolving site of old hemorrhage. the collection is not dramatically changed in size from the previous exam. a small fluid-fluid level is present within the collection. the collection demonstrates intermediate t1 signal and does not enhance. the collection is draped posterior and inferiorly around the transplant kidney and measures approximately 10 cm in craniocaudal dimension, by approximately 2 cm. following contrast administration, a large wedge-shaped perfusion defect is noted within the mid and upper pole of the transplant kidney, representing an area of infarct. innumerable other small cortical perfusion defects are noted on the arterial phase with most of these defects filling in on delayed images. there is aneurysmal dilatation of the transplanted renal artery near its site of anastomosis. this aneurysmal dilatation is in proximity to the previously described collection. the aneurysm is complex in shape, having two lobes each measuring approximately 2 cm in diameter. on the prior examination, the transplant vein, at its anastomotic, site was narrowed but patent. the venous anastomosis is not well demonstrated on this exam, however, multiple hilar veins fill on delayed images, suggesting patency of the venous anastomosis. there is no hydronephrosis and the transplant ureter is normal in caliber. a small amount of contrast material opacifies the ureter and is noted within the urinary bladder, as well. the urinary bladder is minimally distended. a foley catheter is present within the lumen of the urinary bladder. there is high signal within the right external iliac artery immediately distal to the site of anastomosis. a corresponding filling defect is seen on post- contrast images, representing subacute thrombus within the right mid external illiac artery. the thrombus extends from approximately 4 cm distal to the site of anastomosis. reconstitution of the distal external iliac is noted immediately proximal to the common femoral artery. the visualized segments of bowel demonstrate normal caliber and wall thickness. no enlarged regional lymph nodes are identified. the external iliac vein is patent throughout its course. review of reconstructed images was essential in confirming the above findings.
the symphysis pubis demonstrates t2 hyperintensity, enhancement, and loss of cortical margins, compatible with infectious osteomyelitis. anterior to and between the pubic symphysis, there is an irregular shaped collection which measures approximately 5.8 x 1.6 cm, showing a rim enhancement. this is compatible with an abscess. anterior to the collection, there is a blind ending 1.2 cm wide (maximum diameter) tract to the skin surface, which is not communicating with the collection. this tract probably correlates with clinical findings of drainage site. posterior to the pubic symphysis, there is an approximately 1.0 cm small abscess as well. the medial portions of bilateral obturator internus muscles, externus muscles, and pectineus muscles are enhancing, compatible with inflammation/infection. although the findings are compatible with infectious process, tumor cannot be completely excluded. however, no discrete masses are identified. note is made of additional 3 subcentimeter sized microabcesses, posterior to the pubic symphysis, anterior to the rectum. there is evidence of cystectomy. diversion ileal conduit is noted. there is no significant pelvic lymphadenopathy. a subcentimeter lymph node is noted at the left inguinal region. reformatted images confirmed the above findings.

there is a 6.3 x 6.2 x 4.1 cm soft tissue mass in the retroperitoneum inferior to the right kidney. the ureter is partially visualized, extending around the right lateral, superior aspect of the mass. there is marked hydronephrosis. the inferior vena cava is encircled by the lesion at the level of l3-4. ivc is markedly narrowed by remains patent. in the true pelvis, there is a soft tissue mass adjacent to the right internal iliac vessels which contains multiple small cysts and is consistent with an ovary. this measures 2.7 cm in greatest dimension. no definite lymph node enlargement is seen.
the left renal pelvis is dilated, without associated calyceal dilatation. there is a large susceptibility artifact seen within the left renal pelvis, compatible with renal calculi. two subcentimeter renal cysts are seen, one in each kidney. the patient is status post cystectomy with ureteral diversion. the ureters and ileoconduit are visualized, without dilatation. since the previous study, the patient developed a 4.6 (cc) x 2.9 (trv) cm collection within the left psoas muscle. the collection has peripheral enhancement, compatible with an abscess. there are some t2 hyperintensities adjacent to the abscess within the psoas muscle, representing inflammation. there is a large gallstone.
susceptibility artifact is noted in the bilateral medial proximal thighs compatible with previous bypass surgery. there is subcutaneous edema noted in the left gluteal region in the area of patient's palpable concern (marker was placed over patient's area of concern). the septations within the subcutaneous fat in this region are thickened. there is no focal fluid collection. there are focal areas of low t1 and t2 signal, which may represent early calcification. these findings are non-specific and may be related to focal cellulitis/fat necrosis and/or previous trauma. the gluteal muscles demonstrate normal appearance without abnormal signal. no adenopathy is present. no free fluid is present in the pelvis.
there is evidence of rectal prolapse, with the distal rectum measuring at 5.6 cm below the pubococcygeal line. there is also a focal 7-8 mm-size enhancement at the posterior rectum in both arterial and venous phase, located at 1.5 cm above the prolapsed distal-most rectum. this appearance probably represents an ulcer or a fissure. there is a good fat plane between the anterior rectum and vagina, without evidence of colovaginal fistula. the fat plane between the urethra and vagina is also well preserved. the bladder neck is at 1.5 cm above the inferior pubococcygeal line. there is no abscess in the pelvis. there is no evidence of perianal fistula.
the cystic-appearing region described on the ct of ___, at the surgical margin of the rectal pouch, no longer has a mass-like appearance. no lesion is seen in this region. the ovaries are atrophic. there are multiple uterine fibroids. there is no free fluid or lymph node enlargement. a colostomy is noted in the left lower quadrant. subtraction images show no abnormal enhancement in the adnexa. the uterine fibroids enhance heterogeneously. it is noted that there is a moderate amount of material in the rectum, which may be barium from a previous study.
overall, there is no significant change in appearance of extensive decubitus ulcers and fistulous tracts within the lower spine and pelvis. a large decubitus ulcer arising from approximately the l2 vertebral level involves the paraspinal muscles, extending to the l5 vertebral body and sacrum. there is continued extensive marrow signal abnormality within the sacrum and adjacent portions of the iliac bones, and there is destruction of the l5 vertebral body. the s1 level is also partially destroyed. the l4 vertebral body is stable in appearance. the largest fluid collection is located in the region of the l5 vertebral body and is not significantly changed in size, measuring 3.9 x 2.5 cm. the anterior paraspinal, parasacral, and parailiac debris and edema associated with this process are not significantly changed. at least three lower pelvic decubitus ulcers are present, one overlying the right greater trochanter, a second large ulcer on the right side, at the level of the pubic symphysis, and a third ulcer on the left side which extends to the patient's rectal remnant. the patient is status post colectomy with a right lower quadrant ostomy. perirectal edema, right paraischial edema, and thickening of the right hip joint capsule are not significantly changed in the interval. there is continued edema within the right ischial bone at the site of prior debridement. there is also stable left hip joint capsular thickening and marrow edema within the intertrochanteric region of both femurs. the collection surrounding the left ischial tuberosity is unchanged. a 2.5 cm right lower pole renal cyst is incidentally noted.
images are directed toward evaluating the hip joints. however, the images are degraded by extensive metallic artifact from the right hip replacement. there is extensive subcutaneous edema noted, along the right greater than left sides of the pelvis and upper thighs. this edema extends along the musculature of the buttocks and upper thighs, also greater on the right side. there is septated fluid within the iliopsoas bursa, initially behind the iliacus muscle and extending inferiorly, just anterior to the anteroinferior iliac spine and hip. this septated collection in the right iliac fossa measures approximately 3.1 x 7.6 cm. there is a small amount of nonseptated fluid within the left iliopsoas bursa and the pelvis. there is no abnormal signal within the left hip or pelvic bones. the right hip cannot be evaluated again due to metallic artifact. a right iliac fossa renal transplant is noted. the vasculatures cannot be commented on due to the lack of intravenous contrast.
there is a 3.8 x 3.0 x 2.8 cm heterogeneous mass in the left adnexa. this is of intermediate signal intensity on t1-weighted images and is predominantly of low signal intensity on t2-weighted images. after gadolinium administration, there is heterogeneous enhancement, greatest in the periphery of the lesion. the borders are irregular, with a spiculated appearance. the mass encases and obstructs the left ureter. in the right adnexa, there are several smaller masses, the largest of which measures 2 cm in diameter. there is a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis. the uterus is atrophic. at the dome of the bladder, there is a tiny soft tissue mass of low signal intensity on t2-weighted images which appears similar on earlier ct studies. this is non-specific but is most suggestive of a fibrosed urachal remnant. the right ureter is normal. only small pelvic lymph nodes are identified. subtraction images show enhancement within the multiple masses in the adnexa bilaterally.
a fluid collection within the left groin has a thick enhancing rim, and is centrally t2-hyperintense and t1-hypointense. there is some layering of content on t2-weighted images suggesting contained debris. this collection measures 6 x 4.7 cm in maximal transverse dimension. a 2-cm fluid-containing and rim-enhancing lesion is present along the left pelvic sidewall adjacent to the left external iliac vein. an additional 2-cm thick-walled and fluid- containing lesion is present just anterior to the external iliac artery and vein on the left. there is marked surrounding soft- tissue enhancement around the left groin fluid collection, along with inflammatory fat stranding extending down the anterior aspect of the left thigh. a 3.1 x 3.6 cm fluid- containing and thick-walled, rim-enhancing lesion is present within the right groin. similar lesions are present within the vulva bilaterally, two on the right measuring 1.9 x 2.2 cm and 1.1 x 2.3 cm, and one measuring 1.4 x 2.8 cm on the left. the distal aorta, common iliac, external iliac, and common femoral arteries are widely patent bilaterally without significant extrinsic compression or occlusion. the proximal ivc, and common iliac veins remain widely patent. there is extrinsic compression with narrowing of the left external iliac vein by the 2 cm necrotic node at the left groin, though the vein does remain patent. there is no evidence of thrombus within. the common femoral vein is patent. a foley catheter is present within the urinary bladder. attached to the right bladder base and extending into the bladder lumen, there is a 2.0-cm round enhancing lesion with an irregular wall containing frond-like projections. the uterus is unremarkable. there are no visualized bony lesions. multiplanar reformations were crucial in assessment of the anatomy and pathology.
the collection and associated signal abnormality and enhancement within the left psoas muscle on previous studies of ___ and ___ have resolved. the filter within the inferior vena cava on previous studies has been removed. findings are otherwise unchanged, with persistent prominence of the left renal collecting system and a large stone in the left renal pelvis.
the distal third of the left ureter demonstrates the presence of a stent and no evidence of dilatation currently. there is enhancement of the ureteral wall. this is likely due to manipulation of the ureter during placement of the stent. less likely, this can be a result of inflammatory change. the ureter can be traced all the way up to the urinary bladder without encasement or mass lesions in its path. there is an exophytic cyst in relationship to the left ovary measuring 5.5 cm which has an adjacent smaller 17-mm non-enhancing hemorrhagic cyst. the rest of the left ovary and the right ovary are normal in appearance. there is a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis. the uterus is normal in size and in signal characteristics. there is no pelvic lymphadenopathy. multiplanar reconstructions on the workstation were helpful in delineating the above findings.
there is a large lobulated pelvic mass measuring approximately 11 x 15 x 10 cm and is located in the midline lower pelvis extending more to the left. the mass is heterogeneous both in t1 and t2-weighted images and is multilobulated with good peripheral enhancement in each lobule and central necrotic areas. within two of the necrotic areas, there is differential layering indicating old hemorrhage. the uterus and the urinary bladder are pushed by the mass to the left side. there is no clear cleavage line between the mass and the parametrium. the mass is intimately related to the great vessels of the pelvis and is flattening the internal iliac vein, but there is no encasement of vessels. there is edema within the adductor group muscles on the right side, corresponding to muscle strain. diffuse high signal is seen in the right hip. nevertheless, this was not a dedicated muscle-skeletal study, and clinical correlation is recommended. these changes can represent degenerative changes or other processes. no obvious fracture is seen. of notice is a known 2-cm cecal lipoma.
the right kidney is normal in size, measuring approximately 11 cm in length, with mild hydronephrosis and hydroureter. the right ureter is mildly dilated to the level of the ureterovesicular junction, where it measures approximately 8 mm in diameter. the left kidney is atrophic, measuring approximately 8 cm in length. no evidence of hydroureter or hydronephrosis on the left. there is a 3.2 cm x 2.6 cm parapelvic cyst. no solid renal masses are identified within either kidney. simple cysts are seen within both kidneys, measuring less than 1 cm. on the right, a single, widely patent renal artery is identified, and on the left, two widely patent renal arteries are identified. the urinary bladder is non-distended, though with a somewhat trabeculated contour, with multiple diverticula. no solid bladder mass is identified. the prostate gland is markedly enlarged, measuring 6.1 cm x 6.5 cm x 5.6 cm. a foley catheter is in place, however, the balloon has been inflated within the prostatic urethra, and should be repositioned as necessary. there are enlarged lymph nodes along the aortoiliac chain, the largest of which measures approximately 1.7 cm x 2.2 cm, adjacent to the right iliac vessels. there is mild abnormal enhancement about the l4-5 and l5-s1 disc space levels, at the site of the patient's previously identified osteomyelitis. the liver, gallbladder, spleen, adrenals and pancreas are unremarkable. multiplanar reconstructions confirm the above findings, and were essential for diagnosis.
there is a 7.2 x 9.0 cm cyst superior to the bladder with no internal structure or abnormal enhancement. there is stranding within the lower mid and left pelvis, with deformity of the bladder towards the right, likely representing scar tissue post op. a right pelvic transplant kidney is present with no evidence of hydronephrosis. the renal transplant demonstrates prompt contrast enhancement. two atrophic native kidneys are present. the right kidney measures 9.0 cm and the left kidney measures 9.4 cm. there is hydronephrosis of the native right kidney. there is also right sided hydroureter with the native right ureter dilated to the level of the cystic pelvic mass. the visualized portions of the liver, biliary system, bowel and pancreas are unremarkable. multiplanar reformatted images were essential.
the inferior vena cava, and iliac veins appear widely patent. there is a linear filling defect within the left external and common iliac veins, to the level of the proximal ivc, consistent with a catheter. incidentally noted but incompletely evaluated on the study is extensive retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymphadenopathy. there is a large perihepatic subcapsular fluid collection, consistent with the patient's known csf ___ (s/p vp shunt).
there is no significant inflow disease. both common iliac arteries, orgins of the internal iliac arteries, external iliac arteries, common femoral arteries, profunda femoris arteries, are normal. there is minimal atherosclerotic disease within the mid portions of both superficial femoral arteries. there is minimal diffuse atherosclerotic disease within the popliteal arteries bilaterally.
visualized portion of the abdominal aorta including the infrarenal portion is normal in course and caliber. single renal arteries are seen on each side without gross evidence of abnormality. the aortic bifurcation, both common iliac, external iliac arteries and proximal internal iliac arteries are normal in caliber and course. the common femoral, superficial femoral arteries and visualized portions of the profunda femoral arteries bilaterally are normal in course and caliber. the popliteal artery, anterior tibial, posterior tibial and peroneal arteries are well seen in the proximal calves bilaterally. on the right side, the peroneal artery is seen up to the distal calf and the anterior tibial and posterior tibial arteries are seen up to the level of the ankle. distal to the ankle, these vessels are not accurately followed due to technique. if there is proposed vascular surgery, dedicated mr angiography for the foot can be performed. the left leg demonstrates grossly normal three-vessel runoff to the foot. however, due to venous contamination, these vessels are not accurately assessed for subtle findings. there is enhancement in the region of the left ankle with abnormal appearance of the tarsal bones. this could be related to the neuropathy in this region seen on the patient's previous radiograph from ___. multiplanar reconstructions on the workstation were essential in delineating the above findings.
there are diffuse atherosclerotic changes within the visualized portion of the abdominal aorta. there is mild stenosis at the origin of the right renal artery. there is a significant stenosis at the origin of the left renal artery. there is a moderate degree of stenosis over 7 mm distance of the most proximal right common iliac artery. immediately distal to it, there is irregular complicated plaque in this vessel over a length of 17 mm. the rest of the right common iliac and external iliac artery demonstrates mild atherosclerotic disease noting mild to moderate focal stenosis at the origin of the right external iliac artery. on the left, there is a 4.4 cm length of non-visualization of the most proximal aspect of the common iliac artery with a very sharp margin towards the bifurcation of the abdominal aorta. this raises concern for a possible artifact caused by stent or by dense calcification with minimal or no flow within the vessels. the patient reportedly does not have placement of stent and this could represent a significant severe stenosis or occlusion. more distally, the common iliac artery is visualized just proximal to its bifurcation. however, there are no prominent collaterals bridging this gap. diffuse atherosclerotic changes are present within the external iliac artery.
there is a 7.6 x 5.1 x 4.7 cm heterogeneous mass within the sacrum which expands the thecal sac. the margins are well defined. there are multiple components of fat within the lesion. previous ct scans show no calcification within the lesion. after gadolinium administration, no enhancement is seen. there is no extraosseous soft tissue mass. there is no free fluid or evidence of lymph adenopathy. the uterus is atrophic. the ovaries are not identified. the bladder and rectum are unremarkable. there is susceptibility artifact from the left hip prosthesis. subtraction images show no enhancement within the sacral mass. there is no apparent change in the mass compared to an mri study of ___ and from multiple ct studies dating to ___.

there is a round, 1.4 cm mass of low signal intensity eccentrically located within the spinal canal on the right at the level of the s1/s2 junction. the uterus, adnexa, rectum and bladder are unremarkable. no muscle atrophy is seen. subtraction images suggest enhancement of the small mass in the sacrum.
there is edema within the asymmetrically enlarged right labia majora. the medial aspect of the right labia is thickened. there is no focal fluid collection or extension of the process into the deeper fascial planes of the muscles about the pelvis. there is superficial subcutaneous edema predominantly within the anterior aspect of both thighs. there is a small amount of free fluid within the deep pelvis. bilateral iliac lymphadenopathy is present, left greater than the right, with left iliac nodes measuring up to 12 mm in maximum short axis dimension. small bilateral inguinal lymph nodes are also present. there is heterogeneous bone marrow signal within the visualized aspect of both proximal femurs. the bladder is unremarkable. multiplanar and mip reformatted images were essential for evaluating the pelvis.
prior study from outside institution not available for direct comparison. comparison with ct exam dated ___. there is diffuse heterogeneity of the marrow signal, compatible with erythropoietic marrow. there is a serpentine hypointense focus within the superomedial left femoral head, with minimal adjacent hyperintense signal on stir images. findings compatible with avascular necrosis. this region measures 2.3 cm in maximum dimension. there is no evidence of fracture or femoral head collapse. there is no associated joint effusion. the right femoral head is normal. there is asymmetric fluid within the left sacroiliac joint, with a focus of marrow edema within the inferior lateral aspect of the left sacrum abutting the joint. there is also inflammatory change, edema, and minimal enhancement within the adjacent soft tissues, extending from the left iliacus muscle through the sciatic notch. findings are concerning for infectious etiology, with involvement of the left sacroiliac joint. there is diffuse non-specific edema within the subcutaneous soft tissues, as well as focal edema tracking deep to the left gluteus maximus muscle, and deep to the proximal quadriceps muscles bilaterally. no loculated fluid collection is identified. there is a soft tissue defect to the right of the midline overlying the lower posterior pelvis, which appears to extend to the level of the subjacent sacrum. there is minimal edema and enhancement within the adjacent right gluteus maximus muscle, without definite edema within the subjacent bone. findings compatible with known grade 4 decubitus ulcer. visualized pelvic structures are unremarkable. the bladder is markedly distended.
the uterus is retroverted, measuring 5.4 x 2.0 x 5.4 cm. a few small fibroids are identified. ovaries are not identified. no adnexal masses are seen. there is a physiologic amount of free fluid in the pelvis. the visualized bowel is normal and there is no significant lymphadenopathy. bone marrow signal is normal.
comparison with ct examination dated ___. soft tissue inflammation and fluid is again identified within bilateral flanks, extending inferiorly along the gluteal muscles. no discrete drainable fluid collection is seen. the subjacent gluteal muscles are not involved. findings could be related to focal phlegmon, without discrete abscess or loculated fluid collection. numerous hypointense foci within this region may represent susceptibility artifact from prior surgery. evaluation of the marrow signal reveals no evidence of edema, avascular necrosis, or fracture. there is no joint effusion bilaterally. there is minimal signal abnormality about the inferior aspect of the sacroiliac joints bilaterally, nonspecific. this likely represents sequela of arthritis as opposed to an inflammatory arthropathy. on sagittal images, there is no displaced labral tear, or full thickness articular cartilage defect within the right hip joint. visualized tendons are of normal low signal throughout, without tendinosis. there is no abnormal bursal fluid collection. incidental note is made of tubing along the posterior right buttock seen on axial images. it is unclear what this tubing represents. there is a foley catheter within the urinary bladder. the rectum is distended with stool.
there is high t2 signal and enhancement in the internal and external anal sphincter muscles between 4 and 6 o'clock, as well as in the adjacent soft tissues in the left ischioanal fossa. at 6 o'clock, there is a faint trans-sphincteric fistula tract (series 18, images 478-480). there is a linear region extending from the trans-sphincteric fistula to the natal cleft, which demonstrates low t1 signal, mixed t2 signal, and homogeneous enhancement (series 22, image 744 and series 18, image 481), consistent with inflammatory changes along the fistula tract. there is a smaller linear area of high t2 signal and enhancement in the left ischioanal fossa between 3 and 5 o'clock, also consistent with inflammatory changes. there is no abscess or other drainable fluid collection. scattered diverticula are noted in the visualized loops of colon. small bilateral fat-containing inguinal hernias are present. the visualized portion of the bladder appears unremarkable. the visualized bone marrow signal is within normal limits. findings were reported to dr. ___ ___ at 5:45 p.m. on ___.
the kidneys are normal in size with multiple cortical and medullary cysts measuring less then 5 mm, one in the left with hemorrhagic contents. there is no hydronephrosis. a gallstone is seen in the gallbladder lumen.
there is a lesion within the inferomedial aspect of the right femoral neck, which extends to the lesser trochanter. this lesion is of high signal intensity on stir and t2-weighted images and enhances after the administration of contrast. overall, the lesion measures approximately 7.5 x 3.9 x 2.6 cm. within both femoral heads, there are curvilinear areas of alternating low and high signal intensity, representing changes related to avascular necrosis. there is also a lesion within the posterolateral aspect of the right iliac bone, which measures 3.3 x 1.6 cm. this lesion is also concerning for metastasis. there are nonspecific foci of bone marrow edema within the right acetabular roof as well as the left iliac bone. there is no hip joint effusion. no abnormalities are seen in the regional soft tissues.
no prior studies at this institution for comparison. study is limited secondary to motion artifact. the proximal right femur is disarticulated at the level of the hip, the proximal femur is displaced proximally and posteriorly relative to the acetabulum. the femoral head is not identified, possibly secondary to chronic infection, old trauma, or post-surgical. the right acetabulum is markedly shallow. there is diffuse edema within the right iliac bone, involving the acetabulum, superior and inferior pubic rami, and iliac ___. there is also marrow edema within the proximal right femur extending to the level of the mid diaphysis. there is extensive complex predominantly soft tissue focus in the region of the right hip joint, which measures 13.8 x 8.2 cm in maximum dimension. on post- contrast images, there is marked heterogeneous enhancement in this region, with focal curvilinear regions of nonenhancement, which are hyperintense on stir sequences. constellation of findings compatible with a complex pseudocapsule of the right hip, with small pockets of fluid. there is marked edema involving the subcutaneous soft tissues and muscles of the right pelvis and proximal thigh, with marked differential circumference of the right thigh as compared with the left thigh. muscle edema involves the gluteal muscles, quadriceps and hamstring muscle groups, as well as some of the adductors, with relative sparing of the sartorius, pectineus, some of the adductors, and the distal rectus femoris muscles. there is significant muscular atrophy within the visualized portions of the left thigh and pelvis. there is edema tracking within the iliacus and psoas muscle on the right, which exhibits corresponding enhancement. there is also a small amount of free fluid within the abdominal cavity. evaluation of the pelvis reveals a distended urinary bladder, with marked wall thickening throughout, as well as several diverticulum arising from the right aspect of the bladder, compatible with chronic neurogenic bladder. there are several lymph nodes within the right iliac chain measuring up to 17 mm in maximum dimension. the visualized portion of the lower lumbar spine is intact and unremarkable. there is a soft tissue defect along the posterior aspect of the proximal right thigh, deep to the proximal femoral diaphysis. there are numerous low signal foci in this region, likely representing air or possible the sequelae of previous instrumentation. the findings are compatible with patient's known decubitus ulcer.
abdominal mra: there is a severe diffuse atherosclerotic disease throughout the visualized abdominal aorta. although there is extensive plaquing, no significant stenotic areas are identified within the abdominal aorta. there are single renal arteries bilaterally without evidence for significant stenosis. there is a relatively long plaque measuring 1.6 cm at the proximal right common iliac artery resulting in a moderate-to-severe stenosis. there are a few moderate focal stenoses and a severe focal stenosis within the remainder of the right common iliac artery. there is a 4-mm long plaque at the proximal left common iliac artery resulting in moderate-to-severe stenosis. mild-to-moderate multifocal disease is seen throughout the remainder of the right common iliac artery.
the visualized abdominal aorta is normal in caliber without evidence for significant atheromatous disease. the aorta measures approximately 2 cm in diameter. both common iliac arteries are also normal.
there is a small amount of free fluid within the pelvis. the right ovary is not visualized, compatible with the history of prior right oophorectomy. the left ovary is identified and is normal in size, measuring 2.4 x 1.2 x 2.3 cm. the ovary enhances after the administration of contrast, and there are no findings to suggest ovarian torsion. no adnexal mass is seen. the endocervical canal is prominent, measuring up to 10 mm. the uterus is otherwise unremarkable. the colostomy is identified in the right lower quadrant. no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are seen. the visualized bone marrow is unremarkable in signal intensity characteristics. mutliplanar reformations showed the enhancing ovarian tissue.
direct comparison with ct examination dated ___, and prior mri dated ___. again seen is a large mass at the rectosigmoid junction, at the site of prior anastomosis, with both intra- and extra-luminal components. as before, the mass extends through the anterior aspect of the rectum into adjacent fat, and is contiguous with the posterior superior urinary bladder wall. there is extension of the mass into the wall of the urinary bladder and the sagittal t2w images (ser 2, im 13) raise the possibility of extension to the mucosal sruface of the posterior bladder. on the current examination, the mass measures 5.1 ap x 3.3 cc x 3.1 transverse dimension (previously it measured 6.4 ap x 4.9 cc x 4.9 transverse). therefore, the mass is slightly smaller on the current exam, and demonstrates decreased amount of central non-enhancement (ie central necrosis or desmoplastic change). there is persistent tethering of the posterior wall of the bladder, and the seminal vesicles also appear somewhat tethered, however, no macroscopic tumor extension into the seminal vesicles is identified. there is persistent injection of the perirectal fat. there is a new large (13 x 12 mm) lymph node immediately posterior to the rectum in the midline, lying anterior to the s1 vertebral body, which could represent focal metastasis, or reactive lymphadenopathy related to chemotherapy. additional smaller new perirectal lymph nodes are also seen. there is an enhancing soft tissue focus adjacent to the left vas deferens, thought to represent a left external iliac chain lymph node, which is somewhat smaller on the current exam. it may be adherent to the vas in this location. the previously seen lymph node within the right inguinal region is not identified on today's exam. there are, however, multiple small bilateral enhancing lymph nodes, which may not be related to the underlying neoplasm. no discrete extension of the rectal mass into the pelvic side wall, or direct invasion into osseous structures is identified.
there is abundant ascites in the abdomen and pelvis and third spacing of fluid with large amount of fluid seen in the subcutaneous fat. the coronal ssfse sequences suggest a nodularity at the lower portions of the abdominal ascites. the uterus measures 7.5 cm in ap dimension x 6.7 cm in transverse dimension x 6.2 cm in craniocaudad dimension. it shows a distended fluid filled endometrium with thick nodular intermediate signal mass features extending from the wall. without contrast, i am unable to demonstrate the vascular supply of those features, but the morphology and signal suggests a uterine cancer. both adnexae show no evidence of abnormal mass lesion. the urinary bladder is collapsed around the foley catheter and therefore its wall cannot be adequately assessed. there is no definite pelvic sidewall adenopathy. the visualized osseous structures are unremarkable. the limited views of the upper abdomen show no hydronephrosis and several cysts of both kidneys. the upper abdomen was limited by dielectric artifact. the external iliac chain shows adenopathy, right greater than left and best appreciated on series 5, image 29.
as in the prior study, there is abnormal signal within the soft tissues posterior to the right sacrum. this degree of soft tissue abnormality has slightly improved from the prior examination. however, there is soft a tissue defect extending to the right aspect of the sacrum. redemonstrated is abnormal signal within the sacrum itself, slightly more extensive when compared to prior examination. these two findings are representative of osteomyelitis. no frank cortical destruction or intraosseous abscess is identified. otherwise, there has been no significant change. note is made of a horseshoe kidney. there is a 15-mm cyst in the mid horseshoe kidney, which demonstrates signal characteristics consistent with proteinaceous debris. the colon is dilated, not significantly changed when compared to multiple prior examinations.
no focal liver lesion is identified. the gallbladder is absent. there has been significant interval decrease in the size of the subhepatic collection seen on the patient's prior postoperative ct scans. there is a residual 2-3 cm collection which is of heterogeneous signal intensity on t1- and t2-weighted images, likely relating to hemorrhagic products. there is also a small amount of fluid adjacent to this residual collection. the spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and native kidneys are unremarkable. no new mass lesion is seen within the abdomen or pelvis. the transplant kidney is again identified within the right iliac fossa, and it has not changed in position from the prior studies. there is no significant lymphadenopathy. the visualized bone marrow appears normal in signal intensity characteristics. no areas of abnormal enhancement are appreciated. on the sagittal t2-weighted sequences, there is a broad-based disc bulge at the l3-l4 level, possibly asymmetric to the right. no significant abnormality is seen at the l2-l3 level.
bone marrow signal within the pelvis and sacrum is normal. no masses are identified within the sacral canal, sacral foramina, or along the exiting sacral nerve roots. the visualized portions of the sciatic nerves are also unremarkable. there is a 2.2 x 1.1 cm focus of intermediate signal within the proximal left femoral diaphyses on t1-weighted imaging. no significant edema seen in this location on the inversion recovery sequence. there is no evidence for cortical disruption. findings would be typical for hematopoietic marrow. post-gadolinium imaging demonstrates linear enhancement posteriorly within both iliac bones, likely related to prior marrow biopsies. no additional marrow abnormalities are identified. there is a physiologic amount of free fluid in the pelvis. the urinary bladder is grossly unremarkable.
there is a very large amount of ascites throughout the lower abdomen and pelvis. scattered low signal intensity bands are seen within the peritoneal cavity, likely relating to the presence of loculated ascites. there is a foley catheter within the bladder. the vagina is distended with fluid, and the vaginal cuff has a somewhat edematous appearance. there is a probable communication between the anterior wall of the vagina with the peritoneal cavity, best demonstrated on the sagittal images (series 4, images 14-15). the communication is not well delineated on the t2-weighted images and is in the vicinity of an area of susceptibility artifact, likely relating to the presence of a surgical clip. no other discrete fluid collection is identified to explain the patient's symptoms of vaginal drainage. no communication is seen between the vagina and bladder, and no communication exists between the rectosigmoid and vagina. there is diffuse, severe edema within the visualized subcutaneous tissues. foci of elevated signal intensity on t2-weighted images are seen within the right iliac bone as well as within the l5 vertebral body. these findings are nonspecific but most likely relate to hemangiomas.
a linear tract emerges from the anal verge at approximately the 6 o'clock position. at the anal verge, there is an associated adjacent 13 x 9 mm region of enhancement. t2-weighted images show hypointensity in the region of enhancement on t1-weighted images; therefore, this may represent fibrosis or early organization. no supralevator collections. note is made of marked free fluid within the pelvis and edema within the subcutaneous fat. fat-containing inguinal hernias are identified bilaterally. subtraction images and 2- and 3-dimensional reformatted images were helpful in delineating pathology.
there is a moderate amount of high t2-weighted fluid signal within the l4-5 disc space. fluid is also seen tracking inferiorly along the anterior longitudinal ligament, approximately 1 cm. there is increasing irregularity along the endplates at the l4-5 level. findings are highly suspicious for discitis. these findings are new when compared to prior examination. no epidural abscess is identified at this level. there is a 3.3 x 2.6 x 3.1 cm right adnexal mass, as demonstrated on the prior studies. this mass is very low in signal on t2-weighted imaging and isointense to muscle on t1-weighted imaging. post gadolinium imaging demonstrates equivocal enhancement within this mass. a few tiny cysts are noted in each ovary. there is no significant lymphadenopathy or a free fluid in the pelvis. bladder is grossly unremarkable. limited imaging of the abdomen demonstrates multiple gallstones within or otherwise unremarkable gallbladder. partially visualized kidneys are unremarkable.
there is widespread metastatic disease to all visualized bones including the spine, the pelvis and femurs. the sacrum shows a broad-based metastatic lesion in the left sacral ___ adjacent to the sacroiliac joint. at this s2 level, there is a metastatic lesion medially on the left in direct continuity with the exiting s2 nerve root. post-contrast images at that level show an extension of enhancement into the neuroforamen. furthermore, at the s2 level is a metastatic focus visualized in the right s2 neuroforamen. however, this appears to have a preserved fat plane between the nerve root and the intraforaminal disease. broad-based metastatic focus is seen in the left ischial tuberosity as well as in the proximal left femur. no focal enhancement is visualized along exiting nerve roots nor is there evidence of abnormal thickening of exiting sacral plexus nerve roots. the sciatic nerve is well visualized as it exits the pelvis and appears normal. incidental findings include a fibroid in the uterus, foley catheter in an otherwise normal-appearing bladder and there was no evidence for hydronephrosis.
a foley catheter is seen in a collapsed urinary bladder. uterus shows normal size and zonal anatomy, however, at the fundus of the uterus there is a signal void with an air-fluid level in it consistent with a small pocket of air in the endometrial cavity. there is no evidence of abnormal adnexal mass. the dynamic contrast- enhanced series when reconstructed suggests thin enhancing tracts extending from the sigmoid colon to the uterine fundus as the sigmoid colon courses superiorly over the uterus. of note, the precontrast t1- weighted images have high signal material within all colonic loops, however, no high signal is appreciated in the uterine cavity prior to or after injection of intravenous contrast. free fluid is seen in the cul-de-sac and also accumulates anteriorly without definite etiology. there is third spacing of fluid with linear tracts in a pattern suggesting lymphedema particularly in the left labial region extending into the anterior skin of the left pelvic floor. i see no evidence of diverticulitis and perhaps a suggestion of small diverticula but this is clearly not a fulminant case of diverticulosis. incidental note is made of right-sided hydronephrosis and at the distal right ureter there is a focal narrowing with a tiny filling defect consistent with a stone previously seen. there is also enhancement of the wall at this level consistent with some inflammatory change. however, the possibility of a stricture at this location should at least be considered. incidental finding is that of a left orthopedic fixation device in the femoral head and neck. in addition, there is a rectal tube in place. there are no loculated peripherally enhancing collections.
the mass is identified in the pelvis and measures 8.5 cm in craniocaudal direction, 4.3 cm in ap direction and 5.5 cm in the axial direction. it is posterior to the bladder. no fat in the lesion. there is increased susceptibility consistent with calcifications which are better identified on the ct. a pedicle is extends from the uterine myometrium to this mass. it is of intermediate intensity on t1 and low signal intensity on t2. this lesion is thought to represent a pedunculated calcified fibroid with mild enhancement. left ovary is small as expected. right ovary is not definitely seen, not unexpected with the patient's age. note is made of recent surgery of the anterior abdomen. there are diverticula in the sigmoid colon without evidence of diverticulitis in the vizualized portions. no evidence of lymphadenopathy. no free fluid. the bones demonstrate a tarlov cyst in the right paramedian side of the sacrum. multiplanar 2d and 3d reformations provided multiple perspectives for the dynamic series.
there is minimal evaluation of the distal aorta, as the imaging was targeted to the lower extremities in this tall patient. this study is technically limited, as the patient moved during the injection of the contrast bolus. there is also some limitation due to venous contamination, more so within the right lower extremity than on the left.
there is a large open defect in the subcutaneous soft tissues extending into the right gluteus maximus muscle overlying the sacrum just right lateral to midline. open defect extends to the level of the coccyx and right sacrum. underlying bone demonstrates normal signal without evidence of enhancement. no focal fluid collection to suggest abscess. there is mild edema within the presacral soft tissues without evidence of pelvic fluid collection. bone marrow signal within the hips is unremarkable. limited views of the lumbar spine demonstrate no evidence of edema; see separately dictated report of dedicated lumbar spine mri. mild edema is seen at the origins of the hamstring muscles. there is also diffuse atrophy of the muscles of the pelvis.
the pelvic veins appear widely patent on 2d time-of-flight imaging. there is an area of slight narrowing of the right external iliac vein as it courses between the uterus and psoas muscle, but no thrombus is identified within the vein. pelvic arterial structures are normal in appearance. the origins of the great mesenteric vessels and bilateral single renal arteries appear widely patent. there is no free fluid in the pelvis. note is made of moderate bladder distention. the uterus and ovaries are normal. no pathologically enlarged abdominal lymph nodes are identified. visualized portions of the liver, spleen, kidneys, and gallbladder are normal. multiplanar 2d and 3d reformations and subtraction sequences, were essential in evaluating pelvic venous anatomy.
patient is status post open reduction internal fixation with cannulated screws present transfixing the right sacroiliac joint and sacrum as well as a screw within the right superior pubic ramus. there is associated marked blooming artifact within these regions. the evaluation of bone marrow signal within this region is limited. within this limitation, bone marrow signal is normal without definite evidence of focal bone marrow edema or other evidence to suggest osteomyelitis. a multilobulated focal t2 hyperintense fluid collection is present within the right gluteus maximus and minimus muscle as well as just deep to the right gluteus minimus muscle adjacent to the right sacroiliac joint. focal fluid collection measures approximately 7.5 x 2.8 cm with a smaller component measuring approximately 5.1 x 2.1 cm. these findings are adjacent to the above described postoperative site. findings are nonspecific and may represent postoperative change as would be seen with a seroma or resolving hematoma. underlying infection is not excluded. a second focal fluid collection is present superficial to the iliotibial band measuring approximately 3.8 (transverse) x 6.8 (ap) cm. again, this is nonspecific and may represent postoperative seroma versus resolving hematoma. again underlying infection is not excluded entirely. there is diffuse subcutaneous edema within the visualized soft tissues. a moderate amount of intraperitoneal free fluid is also noted.
again noted within the pelvis is soft tissue density just posterior to the right pubic symphysis and right inferior pubic ramus; smaller in size than on prior examinations. the soft tissue density currently measures 2.3 x 0.7 cm in maximal ap by transverse dimension, respectively, previously measuring approximately 2.3 x 1.5 cm (___) and 3.4 x 2.5 cm (___). stable thickening along the right perineum is also again noted. the soft tissue densities demonstrate delayed enhancement after the administration of contrast, compatible with scar. there is no evidence for tumor recurrence within the pelvis. the patient is status post hysterectomy and cystectomy. again seen is the ureter cutaneous ileal conduit. no free fluid is seen within the pelvis. evaluation of the osseous structures is unremarkable. multiplanar 2d and 3d reformations as well as subtraction images were essential in demonstrating multiple perspectives for this dynamic series.
within the inferior aspect of the right sacral ala, abutting the sacroiliac joint, there is a 1.6 x 1.1 cm mass lesion, measured in cc x transverse dimensions. this lesion demonstrates low t1 signal intensity and elevated signal intensity on stir sequences. this finding, in combination with the recent pet scanning, is highly concerning for a metastatic deposit. the remainder of the bones are unremarkable in signal intensity. there is no abnormal lymphadenopathy seen within the pelvis. no fracture is visualized with any of the bones. the bladder is slightly distended. the prostate demonstrates a swirled, whirled appearance compatible with benign prostatic hypertrophy. the prostate measures approximately 6.5 x 6.4 x 7.4 cm in ap x transverse x craniocaudad dimensions, respectively for a total volume of approximately 157.6 cc.
the abdominal aorta and common iliac arteries appear widely patent. a focal near-occlusive thrombus expands the inferior vena cava at the l2 level, with a craniocaudal extent of about 2.1 cm. the thrombus does not appear to enhance and is located superior to the tumor-infiltrated l3 vertebral body. the left common iliac veins appear widely patent. multiple masses are identified within the abdomen and pelvis. a large mass appears within or confluent with the left hepatic lobe measuring approximately 9.5 x 18.3 x 6.7 cm in size with heterogeneous signal characteristics both on t1- and t2-weighted images as well as post-contrast images. an additional complex mass is identified within the right sacrum and ileum extending into the pelvis and psoas muscle measuring approximately 10 x 7 x 7.1 cm. again, the l3 vertebral body shows evidence of metastatic disease. a cystic mass, separate from the bladder, demonstrating an enhancing rim with intermediate signal on t1-weighted images and high signal on t2-weighted images measures approximately 6.7 x 5.5 x 5.0 cm and likely has mucoid or proteinaceous contents. note that this mass is not fully evaluated on the current examination. the adrenal glands are nonvisualized. the spleen is enlarged with a craniocaudal extent of approximately 16.5 cm. the kidneys show symmetric contrast uptake without evidence of hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid collection. the visualized portion of the bladder walls appear thickened. subtraction images and reformatted images were essential to the above evaluation.
increased signal intensity on stir and t2 weighted images is seen in a mildly atrophic left psoas muscle. diffuse increased signal intensity on t1-weighted iimages is also seen in the left psoas, consistent with fatty replacement. no focal fluid collection or mass is present. the iliacus muscle and iliopsoas tendon are normal. minimal disc bulging is seen at the l3-4 and l4-5 levels as previously documented on the mri of the lumbar spine. the neural foramina and sacral foramina are normal in appearance with no evidence of intraforaminal mass or nerve root impingement. the nerve roots are all normal. the sciatic notches are normal in appearance bilaterally. the spinal canal is normal in caliber. there is normal osseous signal intensity. there is extensive sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis. the bladder is enlarged and distended. multiplanar 3d reformatted images were reviewed at a separate workstation.
the distal abdominal aorta demonstrates irregular mural contour with focal areas of irregular low signal indicating mural thrombus, findings that are consistent with atherosclerotic disease. atherosclerotic changes involve the common and external iliac arteries bilaterally. a right common iliac artery aneurysm, also with focal mural thrombus, measures 2.0 cm in diameter, unchanged from the examination of ___. the ivc is patent and of normal caliber. there is marked narrowing of the right common iliac vein due to compression by the adjacent right iliac artery aneurysm, although the right iliac vein is patent. the left common iliac vein also demonstrates marked narrowing at the point of crossing of the proximal right common iliac artery, but is also patent. there is no evidence of thrombus within the imaged portion of the femoral veins, or within the iliac veins or ivc. the imaged portion of the left kidney appears unremarkable. there is a pelvic right kidney with two renal arteries arising from the internal iliac artery. the prostate is enlarged, measuring 5.4 x 4.6 x 4.5 cm. marked heterogeneity and lobulation of the enlarged central gland is consistent with bph. the bladder appears unremarkable. there are no enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes. the imaged marrow spaces appear within normal limits. multiplanar reformations were essential in delineating the above described pathology.
the patient is status post right hip replacement. there is mild susceptibility artifact from this prosthesis. evaluation of the lumbar spine from the t11 to l5 vertebral bodies demonstrates multiple metastatic lesions. specifically, there are large right-sided metastatic lesions within the l1 to the l5 vertebral body, the largest of which is an expansile l5 vertebral body metastatic process expanding the l5 vertebral body along its superior endplate. despite these multiple osseous metastatic lesions, the exiting nerve roots are well seen without lymphomatous infiltration. there is no clumping of the exiting roots and there is no compression of the exiting lumbar plexus nerve roots. evaluation of the sacrum demonstrates multiple metastatic lesions, which have increased in size and number from the prior examination of ___. there is a left sacral alae metastatic lesion which has markedly increased in size, currently measuring 3.6 x 4.2 cm (se 4, im 6), previously measuring 3.2 x 2.0 cm (se 4, im 10) in maximal craniocaudad x transverse dimensions. there are multiple right- sided sacral alae lesions which measure 3 and 1.3 cm in maximal dimensions. multiple additional metastatic deposits are seen along the iliac aspect of the right sacroiliac joint. the previously seen left-sided iliac metastatic foci are also again seen. despite the interval increase in size and number of these metastatic foci within the sacrum, the exiting nerve roots are well seen and are not involved by the adjacent expansile metastases. specifically, the right expansile metastatic focus seen expanding the right pedicle of the s1 vertebral body (series 3, image 9) abuts and slightly contacts the exiting sacral nerve root (series 3, images 9 through 14); however, there is no thickening or abnormal enhancement along the nerve root itself. limited evaluation of the abdominal viscera is unremarkable. visualized aspects of the liver, pancreas, small and large bowel are unremarkable. abdominal aorta demonstrates normal course and caliber without aneurysm. bilateral kidneys are unremarkable. 2.2-cm seroma seen within the right inguinal canal , incidentally noted. multiplanar 2d and 3d reformations as well as subtraction images were essential for demonstrating multiple perspectives for this dynamic series.
the large fluid collections in the right abductor muscles and over the lateral right hip have completely resolved. there are no suspicious focal fluid collections on today's examination to suggest an abscess or residual hematoma or seroma. there is extensive edema and enhancement over the anterior right pelvis. this extends from the pubic symphysis over the right superior pubic rami and over the right groin. this is in the site of the patient's prior fracture and much of the enhancement and edema could be the sequela of healing/previous trauma. superimposed underlying infection in this region is not excluded. there is abnormal edema and enhancement in the anterior inferior iliac crests bilaterally, right greater than left. correlating to recent radiograph performed last month, this edema and enhancement likely is related to the patient's recently removed external fixator device. there is a small amount of fluid which surrounds the inferior right iliac bone interposed between the iliac bone and iliacus muscle. a very small amount of residual fluid remains over the far lateral right hip superficial to the muscles deep to the subcutaneous fat. both femoral head contours are normal. there is no edema within the femoral heads or neck. there are no hip effusions. the sacrum is transfixed by transverse oriented screws. the screws cause susceptibility artifact and limited evaluation within the posterior pelvis. there is a left lower quadrant colostomy. no free fluid is present within the pelvis. there are several bilateral shotty lymph nodes throughout both inguinal chains. none of these nodes are pathologic by size criteria.
susceptibility artifact is present bilaterally at the hips, due to metallic hip prostheses. the uteris is identified with age-appropriate atrophy and a 13 mm fibroid. no free fluid is present within the pelvis. large masses are identified bilaterally which appear to be related to the hip joints. surrounding the right hip is a 18.5 x 10.6 x 11.2 cm (in greatest extents) irregular mass demonstrating high and relatively homogeneous signal on ___ weighted images and marked heterogeneity on t2-weighted images. a fat plane separates the mass from the uterus, which is displaced to the left. related to the left hip joint, a mass with similar signal characteristics but smaller is identified; it is located more anteriorly in relationship to the hip joint. the masses are not fully evaluated (no intravenous contrast was administered), due to susceptibility effects and early termination of the examination. in particular, the extrapelvic extent of the masses is not well demonstrated.
the uterus is anteverted and contains multiple fibroids, the largest emanating from the posterior fundus is subserosal, measuring 13.2 x 8.9 x 11.3 cm in the transverse, ap and cc dimensions, respectively. a smaller subserosal fibroid emanates from the anterior uterine fundus, measuring up to 2.8 cm (sequence 4, image #16). there are at least two additional fibroids in the uterine fundus, that are not as well defined. the endometrial stripe is distorted by a submucosal fundal fibroid but is not thickened. there is an ill- defined, heterogeneous region in the anterior uterine fundal myometrium, containing several punctate foci of high t2 signal that may represent adenomyoma versus intramural fibroid. the left ovary is visualized and is normal in size and appearance (sequence 5, image #20). there is a cyst in the right adnexa measuring up to 3.5 cm that appears to emanate from a crescentic rim of ovarian tissue. there are complex, bilateral fluid collections in the pelvis, containing nodular enhancing septations. the mr appearance is most consistent with loculated fluid collections, rather than hydrosalpinx, as suggested by recent ultrasound. the urinary bladder is unremarkable. no evidence of hydronephrosis. no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. note is made of an intrasacral meningocele. multiplanar 2d and 3d reformations provided multiple perspectives for the dynamic series.
in the right pelvis, there is a large fluid collection that demonstrates intermediate signal on t1-weighted and high signal on t2-weighted sequences, suggesting the presence of proteinaceous material and/or blood products. this collection measures 11.8 x 7.0 x 13.1 cm in the ap, transverse, and cc dimensions, respectively. within the collection, there is a small, 1.5 cm adnexal cyst, although the left ovary is not clearly visible. in close proximity, there is a 0.6 cm enhancing structure contiguous with a thin septation (sequence 5, image #21). no other nodularity or regions of enhancement are seen in the collection. the fluid collection abuts the right uterus and a segment of sigmoid colon, to which it appears to be adherent (sequence 5, image #28). while the collection extends superiorly to the site of a right ileostomy, there is no evidence of discrete fistulous communication with bowel. there is a small amount of fluid surrounding the left ovary, which contains a 1.3 cm cyst (sequence 5, image #24) and an adjacent 1.7 x 1.0 cm ovoid structure that demonstrates relative high signal on ___ sequences and low signal on t2-weighted sequences (sequence 5 image #21), most likely representing a small endometrioma, less likely hemorrhagic cyst. the uterus is anteverted measuring 6.8 x 5.1 x 4.2 cm in the cc, transverse and ap dimensions, respectively. the endometrium measures 7 mm in thickness. there are several nabothian cysts. there is mild thickening and abnormal hyperenhancement of a loop of sigmoid colon in the left lower abdomen (sequence 13 image #79), concerning for the presence of active crohn's. no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. the osseous structures are within normal limits. multiplanar 2d and 3d reformations were useful in the delineation of the above findings. findings were discussed with dr. ___ ___.
direct comparison is made to a prior examination dated ___. again, there is a cystic lesion identified within the right aspect of the pelvis measuring approximately 10.4 x 5.6 cm. overall, the size is not grossly changed. along its anterior aspect, the right ovary is again identified. on the current examination, there is a 2.1 x 1.5 cm lesion within the right ovary which is slightly t1 bright and t2 hypointense with peripherally enhancing rim. these findings are consistent with a newly developed hemorrhagic cyst. again, a small nodule is identified along the lateral aspect of this cystic lesion measuring approximately 7 mm in diameter, which does demonstrate homogenous enhancement after contrast administration. overall, the imaging characteristics described are most consistent with a large endometrioma. adjacent to the left ovary, t2 hypointense focus is again seen measuring 13 x 11 mm with imaging characteristics most consistent with endometrioma. this area appears relatively stable in size. the uterus appears unremarkable. several nabothian cysts are incidentally identified. the patient is status post partial colectomy. ileostomy is identified within the anterior right lower quadrant. fibrofatty proliferation is noted about the visualized portions of the sigmoid colon consistent with the patient's known history of crohn's disease. scattered subcentimeter perirectal lymph nodes are again identified, which appear unchanged in size or appearance. the osseous structures are within normal limits. multiplanar 2d and 3d reformations were useful in the delineation of the above findings.
within the anterior aspect of the left iliac crest, a well demarcated t1 hypointense and t2 hyperintense focus is present which demonstrates minimal peripheral enhancement. findings are consistent with patient's graft harvest site. there is overlying stir hyperintensity consistent with mild fluid and edema within the subcutaneous soft tissues. previously described fluid collection within this region has markedly decreased. these findings are nonspecific, however, given the well-demarcated regional appearance of the signal abnormality of the left iliac crest, findings are suggestive of bone graft harvest site. minimal degenerative changes are present at l5-s1 as well as in bilateral hip joints with associated subchondral bone marrow change. small physiologic hip joint effusion is present. remaining bone marrow signal is normal. limited images to the contents of the pelvis are unremarkable.
compared to plain film radiograph ___. bilateral sacral ala insufficiency fractures are identified. there is abnormal marrow signal in both sacral ala with areas of linear low signal consistent with non-displaced fracture lines. the findings are right side worse than left. there is a small amount of fluid in the sacroiliac joints. the iliac bones bilaterally are normal. bilateral proximal femurs are normal. there is no hip joint effusion on either side. both acetabula are also within normal limits. there is mild cortical irregularity at the pubic symphysis without marrow edema or joint fluid. there is a small amount of edema along bilateral iliacus muscles. there is a small amount of dependent edema in the sacral soft tissues. the patient has a small ventral hernia along the left lower anterior abdominal wall.
evaluation of the hips, pelvis and lumbar spine demonstrates no evidence for acute fracture or avn. there are extensive acute hemorrhagic (bright on t2, dark on t1) collections in the psoas musculature bilaterally, tracking into the iliacus muscles (left greater than right) more inferiorly. additionally, there is a large, approximately 7.1 x 9.5 cm layering left retroperitoneal hematoma, tracking along the lateroconal fascia. there is no evidence for intraperitoneal fluid. no suspicious lymphadenopathy is seen. the lack of contrast administration limits the examination of actively bleeding vessels. superinfection of these collections cannot be excluded. bilateral fat-containing inguinal hernias, left greater than right are also noted. a catheter is visualized within the bladder.
the prostate gland measures 2.8 x 4.1 x 3.1 cm maximal ap x transverse x craniocaudad dimension, respectively for a total volume of 18.5 cubic cm. the central gland demonstrates diffuse low signal without any concerning areas of enhancement. the peripheral zone demonstrates homogeneously bright signal intensity on t2-weighted images. the seminal vesicles are distended bilaterally. no prostatic abscess is seen. there is no lymphadenopathy within the pelvis. no ascites is seen. a suprapubic catheter is visualized within an extremely thick walled enhancing bladder, compatible with cystitis. there is enhancement of the bladder wall and urethra after the administration of contrast, compatible with inflammatory change. evaluation of the osseous structures is unremarkable. multiplanar t1 and t2-weighted images as well as subtraction sequences were essential in demonstrating multiple perspectives for this dynamic series.
there is interval progression of the bilateral enlargement and signal abnormality within both iliopsoas muscle. there is diffuse enhancement of the psoas muscles bilaterally, with an area of central hypoenhancement. the high t2 signal now extends to the iliacus muscle on the left, and also to the iliopsoas insertions on the lesser trochanters. although this was seen previously on the right, there is clear progression of findings on the left. the right iliac muscle was seen to be involved previously. there are scattered areas of t1 hyperenhancement within both psoas muscles. the kidneys, spleen, and liver are also normal in signal, without evidence of infarcts or abscess collections. the susceptibility artifacts adjacent to the pancreatic head are again seen due to multiple metallic foci. there is a simple cyst within the upper pole of the left kidney measuring 9 mm. the known infiltrating mesenteric mass is better appreciated on the ct from ___. there is edema within the anterior compartment of the thigh musculature. the vertebral bodies and intervertebral disc spaces are unremarkable.
the abdominal aorta and common iliac arteries are normal in caliber bilaterally. the right internal iliac artery is dilated from its origin, measuring up to 11 mm in diameter. just distal to the takeoff of the first branch of the internal iliac artery (iliolumbar artery; 100:34) there is a crescentic area of signal abnormality and expansion of the vessel, consistent with dissection. the dissection extends inferiorly along the internal iliac artery and continues along a tortuous branch which courses medially and anteriorly to the base of the bladder, likely the superior vesical artery (100:26). at its largest dimension, the diameter of the involved segment measures 2.9 cm. hyperintensity on pre- contrast t1- weighted images is consistent with thrombosis within the false lumen. post- contrast images show flow within the true lumen of the involved vessel as well as within multiple branches of the internal iliac artery. in particular, the obturator artery is patent, although enveloped at its origin by the dissection, and the superior gluteal artery is patent and does not display evidence of dissection. more lateral and slightly anterior along the right pelvic sidewall is an oval structure which shows partial progressive enhancement measuring 1.8 x 1.0 cm (101a:79), likely representing a partially thrombosed pseudoaneurysm of a pelvic sidewall vessel. the left internal iliac artery is normal in caliber with a focal area of crescentic mural thickening and non-enhancement (100:38), consistent with nonocclusive plaque. the bilateral external iliac arteries and visualized portions of the common femoral arteries, as well as the imaged portion of the abdominal aorta, are patent and normal in caliber. the imaged portion of the bladder, prostate and seminal vesicles, rectum and sigmoid colon appear within normal limits as does the marrow signal. multiplanar reformations were essential in delineating the above-described findings.
again seen are multiple osseous lesions which demonstrate low signal intensity on t1-weighted images and t2 hyperintensity with homogenous contrast enhancement, and distributed within the lower lumbar spine, sacrum, and iliac bones. these appear similar in distribution in comparison to the prior study, though the dominant lesions are smaller in size. for example, within the right sacral ala, there is a lesion which measures 3.1 x 3.0 cm (series 100, image 51), compared to 3.9 x 3.8 cm on the prior study from ___. there is no evidence of compression of exiting sacral or lumbar nerve roots. there is marked fatty infiltration and atrophy involving the right iliopsoas muscle, gluteus medius, and rectus muscles. these appear similar in configuration in comparison to study from ___, but are new in comparison to ___, and presumably reflect changes related to interval surgery at that time involving the proximal right femur. note is again made of artifacts relating to metallic hardware in the region of the right hip. no pelvic lymphadenopathy is seen. the bowel is normal in appearance. no free fluid is seen. fatty marrow in the lower lumbar spine, sacrum, and iliac bones are again noted, consistent with change related to known radiation therapy. there is a poorly assessed t1 hypointense focus within the liver (series 10, image 7), which corresponds to focal hepatic abnormalities seen on prior ct scan from ___. multiplanar 2d and 3d reformations were essential in evaluating the dynamic series.
there is enlargement of the post-foraminal l5 nerve roots, right more so than left, with approximate diameter of the right and left nerves measuring ~ 1 cm and 6 mm, respectively, as they course along the anterior aspect of the right hemisacrum (series 3, image 18). these also demonstrate abnormal enhancement (series 201, image 66). this is in contrast to its more diminutive and normal morphologic appearance on recent ct of the pelvis dated ___, at which point these nerves were significantly narrower in caliber at that same location. there is also abnormal enlargement (series 3; images 20, 22) and enhancement (series 201) of the s1 and s2 nerve roots, right greater than left, as they exit their sacral foramina, though to a lesser extent than at the l5 level. incidental note is made of a small, well-circumscribed focus of t2 hyper- intensity which was not previously identified on other forms of imaging, just inferior to the s2 nerve root, which likely represents a perineural cyst. no abnormal lymphadenopathy. visualized bowel loops are unremarkable. vascular structures are intact. there is a foley catheter in the bladder.
the uterus is anteflexed and normal in contour and measures 6.8 cm in craniocaudal x 4.2 cm in transverse and 2.8 cm in ap dimension. the endometrial thickness is within normal limits. the previously noted cystic lesion in the left ovary has decreased in size now measuring approximately 0.7 cm (previously 0.9 cm on ___). there is a right anterior abdominal wall colostomy. as before, note is made of a large cystic lesion in the right adnexa that measures 9.3 cm in ap, 6.2 cm in transverse and 10.3 cm in craniocaudal dimension. this lesion demonstrates low-intensity signal characteristics on t1 and high-signal intensity on t2 and does not demonstrate appreciable enhancement. this lesion conforms to the peritoneal cavity and surrounds the right ovary. these findings are most consistent with a peritoneal inclusion cyst. there is a 1.1-cm cyst in the right ovary that is stable when compared with the prior study. small amount of proteinaceous material is present in the right fallopian tube. the previously noted hemorrhagic right ovarian cyst has markedly decreased in size and now measures approximately 0.6 x 0.7 cm (previously 2.1 x 1.5 cm). no suspicious enhancing lesions are seen in the right adnexa. the urinary bladder is not fully distended but appears to be unremarkable. there appears to be diffuse wall thickening and increased enhancement of the sigmoid colon with adjacent fibrofatty proliferation consistent with the patient's known crohn's disease. several prominent perirectal lymph nodes are again noted, the largest of which measures 0.6 cm in short axis and 1.2 cm in long axis. the visualized osseous structures are within normal limits. multiplanar 2d and 3d reformations were helpful in the delineation of the above findings.
there is a well-circumscribed mass in the right gluteal compartment. the mass abuts the right iliac ___ and has caused scalloping and remodelling of the right iliac ___. the signal intensity is iso- to hypointense to muscle on t1- weighted sequence and hyperintense on stir and t2 sequences. the signal characteristics are somewhat complex with irregular septations through the lesion. these septations demonstrate somewhat nodular enhancement at the superior aspect of the lesion. the lesion measures 9 x 8 x11 cm in diameter. while not entirely specific, the signal characteristics are highly suggestive of an intramuscular myxoma. the size is not significantly changed compared to recent ct, and it is noted that a lesion was present in this location on mri in ___. it was not completely evaluated at that time. there is a lobulated area of t2 and stir high signal, anterior to the left femoral vessels in the left inguinal region. this measures 5 x 4 x 4 cm in diameter and may represent a small resolving hematoma or seroma related to recent surgery. there is generalized subcutaneous and soft tissue edema consistent with an anasarca pattern. there are bilateral small greater trochanteric bursal effusions. no significant focal bone lesion is evident.
in a small branch of the proximal profunda femoris artery most probably in the medial circumflex femoral artery there is an aneurysmatic caliber change measuring 3 x 2.6 x 3.5 cm. intraluminal in the posterior aspect is a crescent-shaped formation which shows iso-to-hyperintense signal on the t1-weighted images and hypointense signal on the t2-weighted images. on the in-phase images with the longer echo time there is a hypointense rim visualized. the remaining patent lumen measures has minimal radius of 11 mm in the axial plane. there is no hematoma present. the other major pelvic vessels do not show significant stenotic or aneurysmatic changes. there are several inguinal lymph nodes present without significant enlargement. there is a localized fluid collection immediately anterior to the pectineus muscle measuring 1.7 x 0.6 cm. there is another localized fluid collection seen around the right femoral greater trochanter, most probably within the bursa. further there is hyperenhancement in the synovia at the lateral aspect of the right femoral head. there is a large right renal cyst with a maximal diameter of 4.6 cm. the endometrium shows a thickness of 1 cm and heterogeneous signal on the t1- and t2-weighted images. there are bilateral tarlov cysts present. there is no significant free abdominal fluid visualized. there are no significantly enlarged abdominal or retroperitoneal lymph nodes visualized. 2d and 3d reconstruction and subtraction images were essential in the evaluation of the pseudoaneurysmatic lesion.
the study is extremely limited secondary to patient's inability to complete the examination. coronal haste images were obtained, and no filling defects were noted in either common iliac vein or within the inferior ivc on black-blood imaging. the bladder, sigmoid, and rectum are within normal limits. there is no inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy. incidental note is made of tiny bilateral fat-containing inguinal hernias, and small bilateral hydroceles. bony structures of the pelvis are normal in signal intensity.
there is a single intrauterine pregnancy. the placenta is low and anterior. the patient has undergone previous cesarean section with a cesarean section scar visualized in the anterior abdominal wall. within the lower uterine segment anteriorly, at the placental base, there is very poor definition of the myometrium, and on several images, apparent contiguity of the placental signal with the anterior abdominal wall, the imaging features of which are suspicious for placental tissue at least insinuating into or touching the anterior abdominal wall. representative images include (2:26; 2:22; 3:78). in addition, nodularity along the posterior aspect of the bladder with at least deformation of the bladder mucosa is again seen (2:34, 3:77). this is potentially concerning for placental involvement of the bladder wall, although no definite mucosal interruption is visualized. there is no evidence of hemorrhage. the cervix measures 3.6 cm. this examination is not targeted for evaluation of the fetus. moderate hydronephrosis of the left kidney consistent with hydronephrosis of pregnancy, has slightly progressed since the previous examination. mild right-sided hydronephrosis is present. the left ovary appears normal (3:24). the right ovary (3:34) appears normal. the appearance of the ovaries is unchanged from the prior mri of ___, although they were better visualized at that time.
the patient has a left femoral prosthesis which causes artifact and distorts some of the surrounding bone and soft tissues. a large fluid collection compatible with a seroma is again identified in the posterior aspect of the hip and thigh and extends medially and abuts the left aspect of the sacrum. there is thin peripheral enhancement of this fluid collection, which appears not significantly changed from the prior study. the collection extends as far inferiorly as could be included on the thigh images. however, the inferior extent is not fully imaged. overall, the appearance of the fluid collection is not significantly changed from the prior examination. the enhancing soft tissue mass which is in the left presacral region appears to be increased in size compared to the two prior studies. direct comparison with the most immediate prior study is difficult due to different techniques. however there is definite increase in size of the mass from the ___ study. there is further inferior extension of the mass towards the lower presacral/perirectal region. there is additional bulk of the mass along the left pelvic sidewall. in addition, again noted is extension of the enhancing mass into the left s2, s3, and s4 sacral foramina. while extension into these foramina were also seen on the study dated ___, the amount of extension into the left s2 sacral foramen appears to be increased from that study. there is continued edema within the left thigh and gluteal musculature. in addition, gluteal muscular atrophy is also noted. there is continued nonspecific bladder thickening diffusely.
subcutaneous edema in the right buttock. this does not extend into the ischioanal fossa. multiple prominent dilated veins are seen in the perineum, perirectal region and rectal wall. these may be secondary to varices from the patient's liver disease. there is also fibrofatty proliferation of the perirectal fat. there is thickening and edema of the wall of the rectum as well probably due to proctitis. no anal fistula is seen. the anus appears unremarkable. small bilateral external iliac nodes. a 1.7 cm right ovarian cyst. recommend ultrasound followup. a critical finding notification was posted in info radiology. multiplanar 2d and 3d reformations delineate the dynamic series with multiple perspectives.
since the previous study, the patient is status post partial colectomy with residual rectal stump. there is transmural heterogeneous enhancement seen in the area of prior tumor at the rectal stump probably due to residual tumor. the rectal wall thickness in this region is 8 mm in width compared with previous 16 mm, demonstrating significant response. a discrete measurable mass is not seen on the current study. more inferiorly, the abnormal rectal wall (probably due to radiation) is also thickened to 5 mm but without significant enhancement. there is edema in the perirectal fat, probably also treatment effect. there are several perirectal nodes posterior to the superior margin of the rectal stump. three nodes seen in this region and are enhancing on series 200, image 95; largest is 8 mm. further inferiorly there is one additional perirectal node measuring 5 mm on series 200, image 85. there is a complex fluid collection anterior to the mesorectal fascia superior to level of the rectal stump measuring 3.1 x 2.2 cm on series 4, image 7. this has a thickened t2 hypointense wall, suggesting fibrotic change. no appreciable internal enhancement of the collection. findings are probably due to postoperative seroma, cannot exclude abscess (correlate clinically). stoma right lower quadrant from ileostomy. there are subcentimeter sacral lesions seen such as in the left sacrum on series 6, image ___ and series 8, image 10 in the right sacrum. with vague hypointensity on t2w images, slight enhancement after iv contrast, and suggestion of slight interval enlargement, these are concerning for possiblity of bony metastases. multiplanar 2d and 3d reformations delineated the dynamic series with multiple perspectives.
the central gland is enlarged with a heterogenous swirled and whorled appearance on t2-weighted imaging compatible with benign prostatic hypertrophy. there is abnormal signal intensity involving the right posterior peripheral gland extending from the base into the mid gland. this measures approximately 2.3 cm in diameter. it is compatible with prostate carcinoma. there is possible involvement of the left base with ill-defined abnormal low signal intensity on t2-weighted imaging in the left base. there is additional midline low signal abnormality at the prostate apex. this also could represent prostate carcinoma. a more detailed assessment could be performed with endorectal coil and dynamic contrast mr. there is a minor degree of free fluid in the pelvis. there is no pelvic visualized lymphadenopathy. there is no significant focal bone lesion.
again seen in the left buttock is a lobulated heterogeneous mass measuring at least 16.0 x 9.3 cm in greatest transaxial dimension which is predominantly hyperintense on t2-weighted images with multiple low signal intensity loculations, and which shows heterogeneous enhancement on post- gadolinium images. along its medial aspect, there is tumor extension into the pelvis via infiltration of the tumor along the left obturator internus muscle (9:34), with abnormal signal within the obturator at this location consistent with edema on t2-weighted images, and with symmetric enhancement of the obturator muscle consistent with tumor infiltration. posteriorly, lobulated t2 hyperintensity along the superior aspect of the levator sling on the left is consistent with tumor infiltration. this portion of the infiltrative mass extends to and touches the lateral aspect of the rectum (9:31), and continuing superiorly and posteriorly, extends into the sacral neural foramina from s2 through s4 (9:32, 27, 23 as representative images). the left-sided l4-l5, and s1 nerve roots are encased by tumor just distal to their exit from the neural foramina (9:10, 18), and at the level of the greater sciatic foramen there is engulfment of the sciatic nerve with confluent tumor mass. while abnormal signal associated with the infiltrative mass approaches the lateral wall of the bladder and lateral margin of the prostate (11:6), there is no definite evidence of enhancement. the bladder appears mildly thickened and trabeculated but is collapsed and the seminal vesicles are symmetric. involvement of the osseous structures is better evaluated on the dedicated protocol performed on ___, although no definite osseous destructive process is appreciated. asymmetry of the iliopsoas musculature, with greater bulk of the right iliopsoas in comparison with the left (16:23), is appreciated, although no abnormal enhancement is identified on the right to suggest the presence of a mass. susceptibility artifact from previous left hip reconstruction and femoral osseous grafting is appreciated. multiplanar reformatted images were essential in delineating the above- described findings.
the bladder is distended and thin walled. the rectum appears unremarkable. the uterus is anteverted and retroflexed measuring 10.1 x 4.4 x 5.1 cm. there is a small amount of fluid within the endometrial cavity. in both adnexa are again noted complex cystic structures, some of which have a somewhat tubular appearance. there is a drain extending across the right anterior pelvic wall into one of the cystic components in the right adnexa. in comparison to the prior studies, there has been development of diffuse area of intermediate signal intensity on both t1w and t2w images throughout the pelvis. following contrast administration thehere is diffuse enhancemnt thoughout this region. there is no evidence of hemorrhage within this material. there also appears to be enhancement along the pelvic sidewalls, and probably along the distal peritoneal surface. in the pelvis, there are prominent loops of small bowel noted with air-fluid levels measuring up to 2.5 cm in diameter. the signal within the bone marrow appears intact. along the pelvic sidewalls bilaterally, there are borderline- sized lymph nodes. the common external and internal iliac arteries and veins opacify normally.
there is an osseous defect in the anterior inferior iliac bone at the site of previous bone graft harvest. contained within the defect is relative high t1 and t2 signal most likely represents postoperative hemorrhage about the graft site. there is a small amount of t2 hyperintense signal tracking anteriorly along the anterior abdominal musculature. this terminates in approximately 1 cm collection. while this may represent postoperative hematoma/seroma, an infected loculated fluid collection cannot be excluded. in addition, there is edema tracking and infiltrating along the subcutaneous fat at the surgical site. there is edema extending through the lateral aspect of the gluteus medius muscle. stranding and edema tracts through the gluteus maximus and minimus muscle. no intramuscular fluid collections are present posteriorly. no intrapelvic fluid collection or abscess is seen. there is a small amount of edema in the subcutaneous fat along the left hip. there is a mild amount of edema in the left gluteus medius and minimus muscles anteriorly as well. there is a foley catheter in a decompressed bladder.
a unilocular cystic lesion in the pelvis, located immediately superior to the bladder, measures 68 x 65 x 55 mm (ap x transverse x vertical). the lesion demonstrates a slightly thickened irregular wall with a small amount of dependent layering debris. although cystic in nature, the fluid is slightly less t2-hyperintense than simple fluid. the lesion closely approaches the upper rectum and also may be tethered or connected to the sigmoid colon in the right lower quadrant. however, there is no definite bowel communication. the lesion appears separate from the bladder. mild presacral edema is present but no ascites. there is no lymphadenopathy. limited imaging of the non-distended bladder, prostate, rectum, and seminal vesicles is unremarkable. there are no suspicious osseous lesions.
in the right adnexal region on the t2-weighted imaging, there are multiple contiguous cystic structures with some lower signal-appearing areas on the t2-weighted imaging. this complex cystic mass in the right adnexa measures 4 cm in transverse x 2.8 cm in ap x 5.2 cm in craniocaudal dimension. in the left adnexa, again a complex cystic structure is identified measuring 2.7 cm in transverse x 2.8 cm in ap x 4.2 cm in craniocaudal dimensions. similarly it contains multiple cystic components with some more solid areas of low-signal intensity on t2-weighted imaging. there is enhancement of the solid areas in both adnexal regions post administration of contrast. there is diffuse progressive enhancement within the fat and mesentery in the pelvis. there are adherent bowel loops in the pelvis especially in the right lower quadrant and appearances may represent an inflammatory phlegmon. there is susceptibility artifact in the anterior abdominal wall and just deep to the recti musculature which may represent a previous cesarean section. within the region of the distal uterus anteriorly, there is an area of low- signal intensity on t2-weighted imaging which projects into the lumen. this does not demonstrate significant enhancement post contrast. it may represent a hemorrhagic or proteinaceous endometrial cystic lesion. some free fluid is noted in the pelvis. there is some thickening/tethering of the sigmoid ___. the bladder appears unremarkable. no evidence of any significant lymphadenopathy. the osseous structures where visualized are normal. 2d and 3d reformations provided multiple perspectives for the dynamic series.
there is extensive signal abnormality throughout the osseous pelvis and left femur from the level of the intratrochanteric region distally, all worrisome for metastases given the history provided. specifically, there are prominent lesions throughout the iliac bones, sacrum, and left femur. the left femur appears mottled on the prior ct, worrisome for potential future site of pathologic fracture. no acute fracture is seen in the left femur at this time. the right proximal femur and a large portion of the right pelvis is obscured by susceptibility artifact from the total hip arthroplasty. there is a bilobed lobulated heterogeneous collection centered in the left pectineus, adductor magnus, and obturator externus, heterogeneously hyperintense on t1-weighted images, heterogeneously hyperintense on t2- weighted images, and demonstrating no internal enhancement, consistent with a hematoma. post-gadolinium images demonstrate no internal enhancement of the collection. there is minimal fluid in the left hip, which does not meet criteria for joint effusion. a small amount of free fluid is noted in the pelvis. no focal abcess is identified. this is subcutaneous edema throughout both thighs.
very limited study, terminated before completion per patient request due to extreme discomfort and agitation. coronal t1- weighted images demonstrate avascular necrosis in both femoral heads with edema throughout the right femoral neck and extensive osteoarthritic changes involving both hips. there is destruction at l2-3, the site of prior discitis osteomyelitis. a motion limited coronal stir sequence was obtained which in addition to the femoral head shows edema tracking throughout the adductor muscles bilaterally and extensive subcutaneous edema about the thighs bilaterally. coronal stir sequence does not image the l2-3 spinal level to assess for active edema or inflammation. the images are essentially nondiagnostic in evaluating the pelvic viscera and osseous structures to a better extent.
there are prominent signal abnormalities consisting of hypointensity on all sequences involving the anterior inferior si joints bilaterally, left greater than right with the sacral aspect appearing more involved than the iliac aspect. there is very faint edema involving the more superior aspects and probable faint enhancement, though no pre-contrast or subtraction sequences are available to confirm. ct demonstrates the low- intensity areas to correspond to areas of sclerosis. there are no definite erosions or joint effusions. small osteophytes are noted. there are no adjacent focal fluid collections about the si joints or involving the imaged psoas musculature; however, there is edema involving the left paraspinous musculature only partially imaged at the most superior aspect of the study of uncertain clinical significance. prominent subcutaneous edema at this level is also noted. several borderline enlarged iliac chain and obturator internus lymph nodes are seen on the left. no other focal area of marrow edema. no fractures.

a filter in the infrarenal inferior vena cava causes susceptibility artifact. no clot is demonstrated within the inferior vena cava above or below the filter. the bilateral common iliac and external iliac veins are widely patent without filling defects. a focal 1.7 cm subtotal occlusive filling defect is located in the left superficial femoral vein, just inferior to the junction with the greater saphenous vein. the abdominal aorta is tortuous and normal in caliber. a tiny amount of free fluid layers in the right paracolic gutter. left renal caliectasis is mild. a 10 mm t2 hyperintense lesion in the upper pole of the left kidney is likely to be a cyst. imaged small and large bowel are not dilated. subcutaneous edema is noted in the abdominal wall.
there is diffuse thickening and abnormal signal associated with the anus. abnormal signal extends into rectum at the anterior and the left aspects of the rectum (approximately 11:00-4:00. there is asymmetry of the levator muscles, with the left appearing more prominent than the right. this is suspicious for focal involvement. the left side of the prostate may also be involved. there is a right iliac chain node (series 4, image 15) measuring approximately 6 mm. bone marrow signal is diffusely low on t1-weighted sequences, reflecting the patient's underlying hematologic disorder. penile implant is noted.
comparison is made to prior pet/ct from ___, as well as prior pelvic mri from ___. again seen is circumferential rectal wall thickening, with symmetrical and uniform enhancement. this is not significantly changed compared to the prior mr from ___. no new lesions or masses are identified, and no lymphadenopathy is seen. sigmoid diverticulosis is present. uterine fibroids are again seen, measuring up to 3 cm in size. small hemorrhoids are noted just inferior to the region of rectal wall thickening and enhancement. the pelvic viscera are otherwise normal in appearance. there is no free fluid. the soft tissues are normal. multiplanar 2d and 3d reformations provided multiple perspectives for the dynamic series.
a soft tissue ulcer in the posterior midline is again noted, and is unchanged from the prior study. the ulcer extends to the cortex of the lower coccyx. again noted is coccyx edema and abnormal enhancement. these findings are consistent with continued osteomyelitis of the coccyx. there is no involvement of the sacrum. moderate bilateral hip effusions are again noted. there is no evidence of femoral or acetabular marrow edema. sacroiliac joints appear unremarkable. also again noted is diffuse muscle edema throughout the pelvis involving bilateral gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and obturator muscles. there is no definite loculated collection identified.
