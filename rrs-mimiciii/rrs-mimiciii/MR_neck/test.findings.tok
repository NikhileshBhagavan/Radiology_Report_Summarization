the examination is once again limited due to marked motion artifact. despite repeated attempts, the study is exceedingly limited in quality. once again, t2 weighted images demonstrate increased signal within the c5, c6, and c7 vertebral bodies. this appears increased compared to previous study of ___ raising the suspicion for inflammatory or infectious process. again, there is loss of definition the c6-7 disc space. no overt epidural mass is identified. again, spondylytic changes are seen in the region from the c4-5 level to the c6-7 level.
there is no evidence of a dissection of the vessels. no masses or abscesses are appreciated within the tissue of the neck. the single sagittal view of the cervical spine reveals mild spondylosis of the lower cervical spine. there is some increased signal within the prevertebral soft tissue at the level of c5-t1 of uncertain clinical significance- infection needs to be excluded clinically. there are scattered jugulo- digastric lymph nodes none of which meet pathologic criteria of size.
the carotid and vertebral arteries demonstrate normal flow signal without evidence of stenosis or occlusion.
on the right there is normal antegrade flow in the vertebral artery. the common carotid artery is unremarkable. a high grade stenosis is seen in the external carotid artery immediately above the bifurcation. there is effectively total occlusion of the internal carotid artery at its origin, with, at most, a barely discernible degree of flow distal to this point. on the left, there is normal antegrade flow in the vertebral artery. the common carotid artery is unremarkable. a pinpoint (99%) stenosis is seen in the internal carotid artery approximately 1 cm above the bifurcation. the external carotid artery is unremarkable.
2d and 3d time-of-flight imaging sequences were performed and correlated with multiplanar mip image reconstructions. noted within the common carotid artery are two areas of signal loss that are unlikely to represent significant stenosis due to location and the raw data suggests an artifact at that location. will correlate with history such as prior surgery in that location or an x-ray of the neck. no diminutive flow significant stenosis is seen of the internal carotid artery or at the bifurcation. no aneurysmal dilatation is seen.
2d and 3d time of flight mra of the extracranial circulation was performed. correlation is made with the recent duplex examination of the carotid. on the right side, there is significant atherosclerotic disease involving the right sclerotic bifurcation with severe 80 to 90% stenosis involving the origin of the right internal carotid artery in the neck. the right external carotid artery origin is unremarkable. on the left side, there is irregular atheromatous plaque involving the left carotid bulb and the left carotid bifurcation. there is near total occlusion involving the origin of the right internal carotid artery with a faint invisible signal seen within the remaining portion of the recannulized left internal carotid artery which could be trace only for a length of 4 to 5 cm. those images reveal no significant flow along the intracranial portion of the left internal carotid artery and the findings could be related to subacute occlusion of the vessels with the increased signal related to possible intraluminal thrombosis. a string size within the left internal carotid artery is another possibility. there is severe stenosis of the left external carotid artery origin. both vertebral arteries are patent with antegrade flow.
there are punctate areas of hyperintensity on the consistent with patient's known history of subarachnoid hemorrhage. a subdural hemorrhage is also noted in the right occipital region. in addition there are foci of increased signal in the posterior parietal region along the convexity bilaterally which may represent tiny acute/subacute infarct versus shine through artifact from subarachnoid hemorrhage. no major vascular territorial infarction noted. no midline shift, mass effect, or hydrocephalus noted. evaluation of the mr ___ ___ good flow in the internal carotid arteries bilaterally. there is good flow noted in the anterior and middle cerebral artery branches bilaterally. there is minimally decreased flow noted in the a1 segment of the right anterior cerebral artery. in addition the right vertebral artery appears small and supplements the right posterior and inferior cerebral artery. fluid is noted in the distal right vertebral artery distal to the take of the posterior and inferior cerebral artery. this could be congenital, however dissection cannot be excluded. in addition there is suggestion of a small "nubbin" noted in the proximal basilar artery and the expected location of the joining of the right vertebral artery. this is again suspicious for distal right vertebral artery dissection. the left vertebral artery is of good size and appears to be unremarkable. the distal basilar artery is unremarkable. evaluation of the right common carotid artery ___ no significant stenosis. evaluation of the left common carotid ___ suggestion of severe stenosis in the proximal left internal carotid artery.
there is soft tissue fullness and heterogeneous enhancement at the base of the neck on the left. there are also enhancing lymph nodes extending throughout the left lower anterior neck. there is some swelling of the left sternocleidomastoid muscle as well. t1 weighted enhanced images demonstrate normal flow voids in both cervical carotid arteries. flow signal is evident in the right internal jugular vein. the left internal jugular venous flow void is not seen. this may be due to collapse of the vessel from the adjacent soft tissue mass or thrombosis. patency could be assessed with ultrasound if there is clinical question.
the extra-axial csf fluid collection adjacent to the craniotomy in the suboccipital region on the left is larger than on the previous examination suggesting a possible continuity with the csf space. the amount of abnormality in the right lobe of the thyroid gland is less evident than on the former examination but there still is abnormal signal within the superficial aspect of the right lobe. there is no definite pathologic adenopathy seen within the neck.
the mra of the neck demonstrates normal flow signal within the carotid and vertebral arteries. no evidence of occlusion or high grade stenosis is seen.
the carotid and vertebral arteries demonstrate normal appearances without evidence of stenosis or occlusion. the fat suppressed axial images of the neck demonstrate no evidence of blood products adjacent to the carotid or vertebral arteries to indicate dissection.
2d and 3d time of flight mr angiography of the right carotid and vertebral arteries demonstrate absence of flow in the right internal carotid artery beyond the carotid bifurcation. there is flow within the cervical vertebral artery up to the cranial base. beyond this point flow signal is not well appreciated, perhaps due to image artifact or vascular narrowing. 2d time of flight mr angiography of the left carotid and vertebral arteries demonstrates irregular moderate to severe stenosis of the proximal left internal carotid artery. on the 3d time of flight images, there is moderate stenosis of the proximal left internal carotid artery. the left cervical vertebral artery demonstrates continuous flow signal up to the cranial base.
no significant narrowings are seen within the bilateral internal or external carotid arteries. the vertebral arteries demonstrate normal flow signal.
comparison is made to the conventional arteriogram of ___. on the 2d tof mra, the severe stenosis is visualized at the inferior aspect of the field of view. on the sequential axial source images, the lumen of the proximal vertebral artery appears spirals superiorly, consistent with the known dissection. the dissection is also visualized on the fat-saturated t1-weighted images as t1 hyperintensity, most prominent inferiorly at the level of the stenosis but visualized up to the superior aspect of the field of view at the skull base. there is very poor visualization of the right vertebral artery flow on the 3d time-of-flight study. the left vertebral artery is normal. the distal common carotid arteries and proximal internal carotid arteries are unremarkable.

both vertebral arteries appear prominent and demonstrate no flow signal. there is a markedly diminished flow in both internal carotid arteries in the neck. on the left side, the diminished flow signal is identified in the internal carotid up to the skull base. distinct flow signal in the distl cervical right internal carotid is not seen.
the study is nearly uninterpretable due to patient motion artifact. repeated attempts were made to obtain satisfactory images. however, the images provided are largely motion degraded. no overt pathology is seen.
there is increased signal along the muscles in the left anterior chest wall with some soft tissue stranding without focal collection identified. for further evaluation correlated with the ct chest of the same day. there is mucosal thickening in the maxillary and sphenoid sinuses with fluid in bilateral mastoid air cells. a nasogastric tube is visualized with small amount of soft tissue fluid within the nasopharynx secondary to the retention of secretions. there is no evidence of focal collection identified in the neck or evidence of an abscess. soft tissue structures are maintained. asymmetry of the oropharynx and the tongue base could be secondary to nasogastric tube.
there is persistent increased stir signal intensity and enhancement along the right posterolateral tongue base. this appears to extend through the region normally occupied by the genioglossis and mylohyoid muscles. however, it is difficult to determine the exact anatomy, given the prior surgery. there is no gross new lymphadenopathy. however, note that this study is limited by pulsation artifact. the airway is not compromised. no definite extension across the midline is identified. the thyroid gland appears unremarkable.
overall examination is degraded by motion artifact. the patient has undergone coil embolization and occlusion of the left internal carotid artery origin at the bifurcation in the neck. there is no distal reconstitution seen. the right carotid bifurcation is patent. mra of the intracranial circulation reveals lack of signal along the intracranial portion of the internal carotid artery. there is opacification of the left middle cerebral artery branches through the anterior and left posterior communicating artery. no intracranial vascular occlusions are seen. a small area of hemorrhage is again noted along the right inferior frontal lobe unchanged from the previous exam. this is of unclear etiology. there are no acute territorial infarcts seen within the brain. the ventricular system is normal and symmetrical. no extra axial fluid collections are seen. there are no new areas of hemorrhage.
both carotid and left vertebral arteries demonstrate normal flow signal in the neck without evidence of stenosis or occlusion. diminished flow signal is identified within the right vertebral artery in the neck which is visualized in its v2 portion. the flow signal in the right vertebral artery is not seen in the v3 and v4 segments. on the axial fat-suppressed images of the neck, diffuse increased signal is identified within the vertebral artery throughout its cervical portion extending to the intracranial portion.
in the region of the palpable abnormality in the right neck, a rounded lesion with a maximum linear dimension of approximately 1.6 cm is identified, just superficial to the right internal jugular vein. this lesion displays a thin rim of increased t1-signal intensity and minimal contrast enhancement is identified layering within its dependent portion. no arterial venous fistula is identified. no arterial pseudoaneurysm is seen. the structure identified is consistent with a venous pseudoaneurysm and is amenable to ultrasound guided compression. the common carotid arteries, as well as proximal internal and external carotid arteries appear within normal limits bilaterally. the vertebral arteries are unremarkable.
there is good flow in common carotid arteries and the cervical portions of the internal carotid arteries. there is no evidence of a dissection. on the source images, the vertebral arteries also appear normal.
the examination is limited secondary to motion. the left internal carotid artery demonstrates approximately 60% stenosis at the origin. the right internal carotid artery demonstrates mild irregularity of the flow signal indicating mild atherosclerotic disease. both vertebral arteries in the neck demonstrate normal flow signal.
mra examination demonstrates normal flow signal within the carotids and vertebral arteries. no evidence of high-grade stenosis is seen. mild motion-related artifacts slightly limit evaluation of mra for dissection. however, no definite evidence of flow signal irregularity is seen.
evaluation of the aortic arch demonstrates patent brachiocephalic artery, right subclavian and common carotid arteries. no stenoses are seen at these vessels. the left common carotid artery is likewise patent. there is no stenosis. the left subclavian artery is patent. there is no stenosis at this vessel. evaluation of the vertebral arteries bilaterally demonstrates occlusion at the respective origins with subsequent retrograde filling on the delayed images. the 2d time-of-flight of this region likewise demonstrates retrograde flow on both vertebral arteries. limited evaluation of the venous structures is unremarkable. on the left parotid gland, there is a low signal lesion on t1-weighted images which measures 9 mm in diameter. this lesion was not adequately evaluated on other sequences as it was not included in the field of view. at the distal trachea, at its right wall, there is a lesion demonstrating high t1 and high t2-weighted signal which measures 1.2 x 0.5 cm in diameter. these findings may be consistent with mucus at the wall. incidental note is made of mitral valve regurgitation on the white blood cine views.
there is good flow signal noted in the common carotid arteries, internal and external carotids bilaterally. good flow signal is noted in the vertebral arteries bilaterally. the left vertebral artery is dominant. no definite evidence of dissection noted in the neck.
the study is minimally limited secondary to motion, especially the 3d images. there is good flow noted in the common carotid arteries, internal carotid arteries and vertebral arteries bilaterally. there is a suggestion of large focal eccentric plaque in the proximal left internal carotid artery causing moderately severe stenosis in the proximal left internal carotid artery. this is only well seen on the axial images. this cannot be confirmed on the reformats secondary to motion. an ultrasound examination is recommended for further evaluation. no evidence of dissection noted.
the right vertebral artery demonstrates flow within the lumen throughout its enitre visualized course. the right vertebral artery is smaller in caliber than the left vertebral artery, however, this is normally seen in patients with a left dominant vertebral artery. no hemorrhagic products are seen within the wall of the vertebral artery on the t1 fat saturated images. acute hemorrhage can be isointense, and therefore follow up mra may be indicated to increase sensitivity for dissection. no intimal flap is seen. no pseudoaneuryms is seen. the left vertebral artery and bilateral carotid arteries appear within normal limits.
there is a cystic structure in the anterior right lateral aspect of the floor of the mouth at its junction with the anterior free edge of the tongue. this measures 23 x 18 mm in cross-sectional dimension. it does not descend inferiorly to the mandibular ramus. there is no associated adenopathy. there is no definite loss of cortical signal of the adjacent mandibular ramus. there is no definite loss of signal in the subjacent fatty tissue.
the enhancing infiltrative left left skull base mass is similar in appearance when compared to the ___ study. there has been interval decrease in size in the fluid collection located posterior and lateral to the mass adjacent to the mastoid air cells. this likely represents a resolving post-operative cavity. again noted is enhancement in the region of the mastoid tip as well as increased t2 signal within the mastoid air cells consistent with fluid and/or mucosal thickening. these findings are not significantly changed compared with the prior study. bilateral maxillary sinus retention cysts are unchanged in appearance. there are no new enhancing masses or cervical lymphadenopathy.
the timing bolus was somewhat unsatisfactory for the gadolinium- enhanced sequence. again is noted diffuse narrowing of the right common carotid artery and right internal carotid artery, similar to prior study of ___. there is no evidence of a 70% or greater stenosis of the origin of the right internal carotid artery, though there is some irregularity at its origin. an aberrent right subclavian artery is again noted, together with a diminished size of the right common carotid artery down to its common origin with the left common carotid artery. there is some irregularity at the origin of the right vertebral artery, which has a slightly reduced caliber compared to the left in the cervical portion.
there is no evidence of hydrocephalus, intracranial mass, major or minor vascular territorial infarction. there is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. a small focus of absent signal is seen within the soft tissue of the posterior nasopharynx, a finding which is stable in comparison with patient's head ct of ___ and is consistent with a bubble of air. the pathological significance of this finding is unclear. multiplanar 2d and 3d time of flight mra images of the neck demonstrates patency of the great vessels. no significant stenosis is identified.
there is a poorly-defined mass on the left at the skull base which is centered at the jugular foramen. the jugular vein is not well visualized. the left internal carotid artery is laterally and anteriorly displaced. the mass does not appear to involve bone or arise from bone, but rather surrounds the lateral and anterior aspect of the c1 vertebra. there is the appearance of infiltration of the left longus ___ muscle at this level, and the muscle is anteriorly displaced as well. the mucosal surfaces of the nasopharyngeal soft tissues have a normal appearance. the most anterior aspect of the mass approaches the left lateral pterygoid muscle. posteriorly, the mass extends between the lateral ring of c1 and the mastoid tip. no intracranial extension is identified on the images obtained. in retrospect, there was soft tissue fullness or asymmetry in this location on the ct scan of the neck from ___ and the cervical ct from ___. the mass appears to have enlarged in the interval since the previous studies. no adenopathy is identified within the remainder of the neck. no other abnormalities are detected.
there is some increase in the abnormal signal in the left maxillary sinus compared to prior studies. nasopharyngeal contours are symmetric. there is a very slightly prominent lymph node in the posterior chain of the neck in the left suboccipital region measuring 15 x 6 mm in dimension which, in retrospect, was present on prior study of ___. it is borderline in size. there is no other definite evidence of pathologic adenopathy. there is no definite evidence of a mass lesion.
the parapharyngeal infiltrative mass is similar in appearance to the prior study of ___. the fluid collection is smaller in size than on the previous examination. there is enhancing soft tissue in the mastoid tip as was present previously on ___. this was new compared to prior mr study of ___ and the ct scan of ___ which showed aerated cells in the mastoid tip. this appears to be unchanged compared to ___. retention cysts in the maxillary sinuses are again noted. there is a small amount of non-enhancing fluid in the mastoid tip. no additional abnormal foci in the neck to suggest lymphadenopathy are demonstrated.
on the sagittal stir sequence there is some increased signal in the subcutaneous soft tissues over the lower cervical-upper thoracic region perhaps related to soft tissue injury or edema. there is no definite evidence of abnormal signal within the neck itself. there is increased signal in the parnasal sinuses and mastoids associated with intubation.
comparison to the prior examination from ___, redemonstrates the enhancing mass involving the left side of the skull base posterior to the carotid space and medial to the left mastoid sinus extending towards the region of the left occipital condyle and hypoglossal canal. there is stable probable intervening bony erosion of the undersurface of the sinus tip. small lymph nodes are noted along the carotid chain. there are bilateral maxillary sinus mucous retension cysts.
there are normal flow signals identified within the visualized portions of the vertebral and carotid arteries with no evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis or ulceration particularly in the area of interest at c7. note is made that the origin of the vertebral arteries off the aortic arch are not well seen to low signal to noise at this region. an aortic arch study with gadolinium enhancement can be performed for better visualization of this area, although it is at a considerable distance from c7.
there is an irregularly shaped infiltrative soft tissue mass involving the left skull base. this mass appears to erode the medial aspect of the left mastoid and also extends to the facets of c1 and c2 on the left side. when compared to the prior neck mri with contrast dated ___, there has been no significant interval change in the morphology of this infiltrative mass. there remains fluid within the left mastoid air cells which is also stable. there is also increased t2 signal in the soft tissues of the left post-auricular scalp, which may represent postradiation changes and/or infiltration of the skull base lymphoma. this infiltrative skull base mass demonstrates mild enhancement on the postgadolinium images. there is no abnormal lymphadenopathy in the neck. there is a heterogeneous signal mass involving the right clavicular head and the right sterno- clavicular joint. this mass is stable when compared to the prior pet ct dated ___. given its increased activity on the prior pet ct, this mass is also consistent with lymphoma involving the right sternoclavicular joint. the right sternoclavicular joint was not imaged on the most recent prior neck mri dated ___. there are mucus retention cysts in both maxillary sinuses.
again is noted the enhancing infiltrating mass at the left skull base extending toward the cervical spine and causing increased signal in the mastoid sinus. there has been no change from the previous examination. no additional enhancing masses or adenopathy are noted. there are retention cysts in the maxillary sinuses.
there is extensive right cervical lymphadenopathy, with large conglomerate and necrotic-appearing lymph nodes, most notable in the jugulodigastric region and lateral and inferior to the right parotid gland. the parotid is elevated by the extensive nodal mass just inferior to it. the right submandibular gland is also anteriorly and medially displaced. enlarged lymph nodes are also identified in the right posterior triangle, submandibular space and lower neck, as well as in the right supraclavicular space. the carotid and jugular vessels appear normal bilaterally. the thyroid gland is normal in size, shape and signal intensity. no gross abnormality of the larynx is identified. the oropharynx and oral cavity, including the floor of the mouth, are symmetric in appearance and there are no discrete abnormally enhancing masses detected. the nasopharygeal cavity appears normal, and there is normal mucosal enhancement. the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoids are aerated. no abnormal enhancement extends into the inferior intracranial space or spinal canal, where visualized.
a pretracheal 4.3 x 2.5 cm mass is identified, which demonstrates heterogeneous but slightly increased signal on fmpir axial images, and isointense signal on t1-weighted images. there appears to be extension into the trachea. two other masses are seen, in the left paratracheal region, and demonstrate heterogeneous but predominantly decreased signal intensity on t1- weighted images. these appear to displace the trachea to the right, without any signs of definite laryngeal invasion. the most inferior of these masses appears to be at the level of or above the thoracic inlet, without any mediastinal extension. all of these masses do not demonstrate any definite gadolinium enhancement. several lymph nodes are seen in the left side of the neck, unchanged from recent ct scan. no overt vascular abnormality is seen. the remainder of the signal patterns within the neck is within normal limits.
the infiltrative mass in the region of the left skull base is again identified with increased signal in the left mastoid. this is slightly reduced compared to the previous examination. on the coronal t1 series there appears o be reduced abnormal signal in the mastoid tip. there is new abnormal signal within the sphenoid sinus, especially on the right side on the t1- weighted sequence. the nature of this abnormality is not known. it could represent a high protein containing retention cyst in the sphenoid sinus or it could represent some hemorrhage. its signal characteristics are not the same as the infiltrating lesion of the skull base. ct may be of use to determine any bone erosion.
no priors for comparison. a nasogastric tube is seen coursing through the esophagus. there are no signal abnormalities within the peritonsillar or retropharyngeal regions to suggest fluid collection. a 14 mm lymph node is identified in the left anterior neck adjacent to the left internal jugular vein. no other lymph nodes are identified. the visualized portion of the brain is unremarkable, but please note that this study was not targeted towards the brain.
only coronal t1-weighted images of the neck were obtained. the study was terminated due to large artifact in the left inferior cervical region. the images demonstrate bilateral posterior cervical lymph nodes, more numerous on the right than left. these lymph nodes may be either the same or slightly larger, as evaluation is limited by slice selection.
the previously visualized areas of enhancement in the right tonsillar area and the retropharyngeal lymphadenopathy is no longer present on the current study. on the current examination, there are no areas of abnormal enhancement. there are small scattered non-pathologically enlarged lymph nodes within the neck and submandibular areas. the soft tissues of the neck are symmetric. the flow voids of the major vascular structures are normal in appearance.
the study is extremely limited technically. the parotid glands are not fully imaged on all sequences. furthermore, extensive coil artifact overlies the right neck, with resultant diffuse signal hyperintensity over the anterior and lateral right neck, extremely limiting assessment of the right parotid gland. note is made on the prior fdg- pet ct that there is a marked discrepancy in attenuation of the parotid glands, with the right parotid gland at that time showing diffuse fatty replacement. allowing for the limitations, no focal mass is seen within the left parotid gland. there is no pathological cervical lymphadenopathy. there is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling. no abnormality is seen within the vertebral bodies.
in the location of the left neck where the mass is marked, there are blood vessels in close approximation to the skin level. a discrete soft tissue mass is not identified in this location. there is asymmetry of the thyroid gland with a small left lobe, and there is a slightly angulated trachea and upper esophagus. the esophagus is distended. no supraclavicular lymphadenopathy is detected. there is a small area of pulmonary parenchymal signal abnormality in the anterior superior left lung that may be related to previous radiation therapy. no other soft tissue signal abnormalities are observed. there are no enlarged cervical lymph nodes.
neck mra demonstrates normal flow signal in the carotid and vertebral arteries. no evidence of vascular occlusion or stenosis is seen. both vertebral origins appear normal, without evidence of stenosis.
there is no evidence of dissection. the flow signal of both common carotid arteries and internal carotid arteries were normal. the vertebral arteries are unremarkable. the circle of ___ appears normal. the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral artery branches are normal as are the vertebral arteries and the basilar artery.
the right carotids show a somewhat tortuous appearance but no evidence of stenosis is seen. both vertebral arteries demonstrate normal flow signal without stenosis or occlusion. the left common carotid artery is small in caliber and demonstrates lower flow signal compared to the right side. there appears to be low position of the left carotid bifurcation. the left internal carotid artery is small in size which could be due to high-grade stenosis the origin. since the mra is somewhat limited by motion, further evaluation of the left carotid can be obtained with ct angiography if clinically indicated. the ct angiography can also help for further evaluation of great vessels of the thoracic outlet which are not visualized on the mra.
the carotid and vertebral arteries in the neck demonstrate no evidence of occlusion or high-grade stenosis. a tortuous right mid vertebral artery is again visualized. at the left distal internal carotid artery, a tortuosity is identified as seen on the previous study. however, there is no evidence of narrowing of the flow signal seen nor there is evidence of abnormal blood products on the current study. the tortuosity is bilaterally symmetric with similar tortuosity seen on the other side.
evaluation of the 2d time-of-flight images demonstrate normal flow signal in the carotid and vertebral arteries on somewhat motion limited study without evidence of occlusion or high-grade stenosis. although no obvious dissection is identified, subtle changes could not be excluded. the fat- suppressed axial images are also limited by motion. no obvious abnormal signal seen adjacent to the carotid or vertebral arteries. on the gadolinium-enhanced mra motion has limited evaluation for subtle changes but no evidence of vascular occlusion is seen.
the 2d time-of-flight mra is somewhat limited by motion. the 3d time-of-flight mra demonstrates normal appearances of the carotid and vertebral arteries without stenosis or occlusion. the right vertebral artery ends in posterior inferior cerebellar artery, a normal variation. no evidence of stenosis is seen within the carotid or vertebral arteries. the fat-suppressed axial images of the neck demonstrate no evidence of abnormal signal adjacent to the carotid arteries or the vertebral arteries.
the 2d time-of-flight mra demonstrates normal flow signal in the carotid and vertebral arteries. the gadolinium-enhanced mra of the neck demonstrates irregularity of the flow signal in the proximal right vertebral artery on the projection images. there is also diminished flow signal intensities seen in the right vertebral artery compared to the left side. there is narrowing of the distal right vertebral artery as seen on the previous cta of ___. on the projection images, the proximal portion of the brachiocephalic artery is not visualized which appears artifactual as this portion is well seen on the source images.
there is a high-grade greater than 80% stenosis seen approximately 6 mm beyond the right carotid bifurcation. left carotid shows mild atherosclerotic disease. left vertebral artery is normal in its entire length including the origin. the right vertebral artery demonstrates normal appearances in the neck as well as in the intracranial region. the basilar artery also shows normal appearance. the right vertebral origin is not well visualized, which could be due to artifacts. this could also be secondary to calcified plaque at the origin of right vertebral artery. ct angiography would be helpful for further assessment of the right vertebral origin if clinically indicated.
both carotids and vertebral arteries are patent. there is possibly a mild short area of stenosis of the right internal carotid artery 1 cm above the origin. however, this also may be artifactual. ultrasound could be performed to further evaluate this. the left internal carotid artery as well as the vertebral arteries are widely patent.
the left carotid bifurcation demonstrate normal flow signal. both vertebral arteries demonstrate normal flow signal. at the right carotid bifurcation, there is approximately 70 to 80% stenosis visualized of the proximal internal carotid artery at the bifurcation.
apparent filling defects are seen in both internal carotid arteries just distal to the common carotid artery bifurcation which are presumably due to turbulent flow. normal signal intensity is seen more distally in both internal carotid arteries, external carotid arteries, vertebral arteries, and the visualized portion of the basilar artery. no area of flow limiting stenosis is seen from the level of the aortic arch to the skull base. no aneurysmal dilation is seen. there is no pathologic lymphadenopathy in the neck, within the limitations of the angiographic technique.
the fat-suppressed axial images of the neck demonstrate absence of flow void in the right vertebral artery region. on the source images of the 2d time-of-flight mra, the right vertebral artery flow signal is also not visualized. the gadolinium-enhanced mra demonstrates flow at the origin of the right vertebral artery without evidence of flow seen distal to that region. both carotid and left vertebral artery demonstrate normal flow signal.
there is no evidence of significant internal carotid artery stenosis. the vertebral arteries are patent. the portion of the left vertebral artery origin obscured by venous contrast on the patient's outside head cta appears to be unremarkable on this examination.
2d time of flight mr angiography is somewhat motion degraded, but demonstrates absence of normal flow signal in the expected location of the right vertebral artery. the left vertebral artery demonstrates flow signal throughout its cervical course and into the intracranial portion. 2d time of flight images of the right cervical carotid artery demonstrates mild narrowing at the carotid bifurcation and severe narrowing of the right internal carotid artery roughly 1 cm distal to the carotid bifurcation. here the vessel is markedly irregular and severely stenotic. there is also the appearance of a severe stenosis of the left internal carotid artery at its origin. there is moderate narrowing of the carotid bifurcation as well. contrast enhanced mr angiographic views are somewhat limited due to venous contamination. however, a high grade stenosis of the proximal segment of the right internal carotid artery is again noted. the left internal carotid artery is not well evaluated, but there is clearly stenosis at its origin.
there is mild tortuosity of the vertebral arteries bilaterally. at the site of clinical concern, there is no evidence of vertebral arterial injury at the site of the known slightly displaced transverse process fractures involving the right c4 vertebral artery foramen. at the level of c4-c5, however, there is slight narrowing of the left vertebral artery, probably related to an adjacent prominent uncovertebral spur, and immediately following this segment there is mild dilatation and tortuosity, which may represent a form of post-stenotic dilatation. this appearance is felt unlikely to represent acute injury. moderately prominent right-sided internal carotid artery stenosis is noted, as well as moderate stenoses of the left internal and external carotid arteries. moderate atherosclerotic irregularity of the distal vertebral arteries and moderate irregularity of the basilar artery is present, probably due to atherosclerosis. the carotid and vertebral arteries both show normal anterograde flow. the t1-weighted images with fat saturation show no evidence to clearly identify a dissection.
comparison is made to prior cta of the head and neck from ___ as well as a prior mri of the head and neck from ___. again seen is marked narrowing of the lumen of the cervical left ica at the c2 level. adjacent to the luminal narrowing is a focus of increased t1 signal, which measures approximately 9 x 7.5 mm which is consistent with thrombus. this corresponds to the lesion seen on the cta and likely represents a pseudoaneurysm. there is likely stenosis of the origin of the right vertebral artery. mild narrowing of the right internal carotid artery bulb is again seen.
there are several foci in the left posterior temporal lobe, demonstrating increased flair and t2 signal, as well as restricted diffusion, suggestive of subacute infarction. there are no foci of hemorrhage. some of the foci demonstrate increased anisotropy, consistent with acute infarction. the anatomical distribution is indicative of embolic etiology. there is no intracranial mass, hydrocephalus, or shift of normal midline structures. the surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable. mra carotid & vertebral arteries technique: 2 and 3 dimensional time of flight imaging with multiplanar reconstructions.
as noted on the prior ct scan, there is a large complex mass lesion in the region of the right tonsillar pillar which extends from the region of the hard palate inferiorly to approximately the level of the cricoid cartilage. the mass demonstrates heterogeneous enhancement with central non-enhancing regions which probably represent necrotic portions of tumor. these areas correspond to the hypodense area seen on the ct scan. as compared to the prior ct, there appears to be no significant interval change in the mass. the parapharyngeal fat planes on the right are obliterated. there is abnormal enhancement extending into the parapharyngeal space. in addition, abnormal enhancement extends posterior to the right cricoid cartilage and also appears to extend lateral to the right lamina of the thyroid cartilage. the expected vascular flow voids in the neck are present. the mass measures approximately 2.5 x 3.1 x 5.6 cm. the previously mentioned submental lymph node is again seen. there is an area of t2 hyperintensity as well as post-contrast enhancement in the region of the superior end plate on the right in the vertebral body of c7. this may represent degenerative change. however, if metastatic disease is a concern, dedicated spinal mri with gadolinium may be helpful to further evaluate.
the study is slightly limited secondary to patient motion. the t1-weighted images with fat saturation are limited; however, there is no overt evidence of vertebral or carotid arterial dissection. the major vessels of the neck are patent. note is made of a moderate-to-severe stenosis of the origin of the right vertebral artery. the carotid and vertebral arteriesm, including the origins and carotid bifurcations are otherwise unremarkable.
the origins of the common carotid arteries appear normal. the vertebral arteries are very tortuous throughout their course but their origins appear to not have any significant stenoses. the origins of both internal carotid arteries are patent. there appears to be a stenosis at the distal left internal carotid artery, as it enters the skull base. this is a location that is highly susceptible to artifacts. however, as it does not opacify with gadolinium, there is suspicion for a moderate-to-high grade stenosis in this location. the right internal carotid artery appears normal.
mr angiography of the neck demonstrates no evidence for carotid or vertebral artery dissection. the dominant left vertebral artery is tortuous particular at the craniocervical junction as well as at its origin. the smaller right vertebral artery is noted to terminate as a posterior inferior cerebellar artery. the origin of the right vertebral artery is not well seen due to artifact. the visualized carotid arteries, vertebral arteries, and visualized intracranial circulation is otherwise unremarkable.
mr angiogram of the circle of ___: there are filling defects noted in left p1 segment, right p2 segment, left mca m2 and its branches, consistent with embolic phenomena. the vertebral artery origins in the neck were not well visualized. however, rest of the vertebral arteries, basilar artery, bilateral ica and aca and right mca were patent and normal in caliber.
both carotid and vertebral arteries are patent, without evidence of stenosis, occlusions, dissections, or aneurysmal dilatations. vertebral arteries are codominant.
there is a congenitally hypoplastic left vertebral artery. both carotid arterial systems and the right vertebral artery are within normal limits. there is a normal anatomy of the aortic arch.
the patient is status post posterior laminectomy and decompression at c7 and t1. there are multiple pedicle screws and bilateral rods. there is t1 hypointense tumor involving the posterior aspect of c7 and t1 vertebral body as the superior-posterior aspect of t2. the tumor extends into the posterior elements at c7 and t1. compared with the prior study, there is increased tumor bulk surrounding the thecal sac bilaterally at these levels, arising from the lateral masses, resulting in slight encroachment on the thecal sac, a finding which appears to have progressed from the prior study. no definite abnormal signal is seen within the spinal cord, but there is significant hardware artifact. note is also made of a chiari i malformation.
there are no prior similar examinations at this institution for comparison. within the anterior portion of both parotid glands, approximately 5 mm well- defined low intensity areas are seen on the post-gadolinium images which are high signal intensity on t1-weighted images. these findings may indicate small intraparotid lymph nodes. there is no discrete mass larger than this abnormalities visualized within the parotid glands. there is no evidence of lymphadenopathy seen in the visualized portions of the neck. in the region of larynx, there is adduction of the left vocal cord visualized which may be due to vocal cord paralysis and clinical correlation is recommended. in the visualized posterior fossa, a small enhancing mass is identified in the region of right internal auditory canal consistent with patient's known acoustic schwannoma.
the right common carotid artery is widely patent. there is a long irregular moderate-to-severe stenosis of the proximal right internal carotid artery which appears to have progressed compared to ___. stenosis is most severe at the level of the distal bulb with a degree of stenosis could be on the order of 75% diameter stenosis. there is also a proximal nearly as severe stenosis at the origin of the internal carotid artery. there is more severe right external carotid artery stenosis than on the prior study. the left common carotid artery is also widely patent. there is a moderate left external carotid artery stenosis and mild-to-moderate left internal carotid artery stenosis. the left carotid bifurcation had a similar appearance on the prior study. there is an approximately 60% stenosis at the origin of the right subclavian artery. the right vertebral artery is widely patent. the left subclavian artery is patent proximally and then out of the field of view distally. the left vertebral artery is also widely patent.
the post-contrast images are somewhat limited. the pre-contrast images show good flow in the cervical portions of the common and internal carotid arteries and the vertebral arteries. the axial source images from the 2d time-of-flight study show linear low signal intensity in the left vertebral artery, at the level of the atlantoaxial articulation, at the superior aspect of the fracture, most consistent with a small, focal dissection. no stenosis of the lumen is seen. just distal to that level, there is some artifact. at the level of the foramen magnum, the flow enhancement of the vertebral arteries appears normal. the distal right vertebral artery is unremarkable. the carotid bifurcations are widely patent. the small focal dissection without stenosis was discussed with dr. ___ by telephone at 9 p.m. on ___.
no areas of hemodynamically significant stenosis or ulceration is present. specifically, within the area of the known cervical vertebral body fractures, the vertebral arteries appear intact without evidence of dissection or aneurysmal dilatation. the patient is left vertebral artery dominant.
flow signal gap is seen on both 2d and 3d time-of-flight images at the left internal carotid artery just distal to the bifurcation. the left common carotid, right common carotid, and right internal carotid arteries appear unremarkable. the vertebral arteries appear patent.
mra of the neck on the time of flight images do not include the area of interest in the region of brain tumor. mra of the circle of ___ should be performed. for evaluation for internal carotid artery patency. the neck mra is normal with no evidence of stenosis at the origins of the internal carotid arteries nor at the origins of major great vessels. the origins of the great vessels are very tortuous the origins of the vertebral arteries as well as the right common carotid artery are very tortuous. there appear to be minimal atherosclerotic plaques of the internal carotid artery origins. the post-gadolinium mra does include the area of interest but it is in a small field of view. patency of internal carotid arteries as well as the anterior cerebral artery is present but this exam should not be construed as a substitute for a brain mra. there is splaying of the internal carotid arteries as well as superior displacement of the a1 segments of the anterior cerebral arteries by the large sellar mass.
the right vertebral artery is not visualized on the 2d time-of-flight images. on the post-gadolinium 3d images, segmental visualization of a tiny right vertebral artery is identified, indicating marked hypoplasia of the right vertebral artery. a moderate grade stenosis of the origin of the left vertebral artery from the subclavian artery is identified. otherwise, the left vertebral artery is unremarkable throughout its course through the neck. there are mild atherosclerotic changes involving the carotid bifurcations bilaterally without evidence of significant stenosis. the carotids within the neck and base of the skull are otherwise unremarkable.
as noted on the prior exam, there are post-operative changes in the suboccipital region with mesh placement. as on the prior exams, there is large amount of enhancing material deep to the surgical mesh. just to the left of midline, superficial to the left cerebellar hemisphere, there is very thick enhancement with central areas of fluid. these have been present since ___. as noted on that examination, these could represent epidural abscesses versus postoperative changes. the enhancing material within the posterior fossa appears to abut the mesh. just to the right side of the interface between the mesh and the skull base, there appears to be a small communication between the superficial enhancing ___ and the epidural enhancing ___. again, this finding was present on the examination of ___, but appears somewhat more prominent today. this could be a result of an infectious process and some dehiscence between the mesh and the right side of the skull base or simply due to post operative inflammation. there is homogeneous enhancement of the superficial soft tissues, which immediately abut the surgical mesh. these are concerning for phlegmon as before. no focal abscess is noted within the superficial tissues. the amount of soft ___ edema on today's exam appears to be very slightly smaller than on the prior examination. as before, there are a few scattered lymph nodes present.
no comparisons are available. there is a large heterogeneous mass predominantly involving the right side of the thyroid gland which measures approximately 7.8 x 5.3 cm. this lesion seems to have central necrosis. there is also leftward deviation of the upper trachea and esophagus. the mass is also displacing the carotid arteries and jugular veins laterally bilaterally. there is no narrowing of the displaced trachea. several small flow voids are seen at the periphery of the lesion which may represent dilated veins or arteries. seen within the right paratracheal region of the mediastinum is a 4.5-cm mass which likely represents metastatic lymph node. there is an ill-defined area of hypointensity involving the posterior right neck which may represent surgical material. there is enhancement and increased t2 signal of the overlying subcutaneous fat and skin which likely represents post-surgical change. at the superior margin of the operative bed, there is a 1.7-cm round peripherally enhancing lesion medial to the sternocleidomastoid which likely represents residual adenopathy (level 3). within the right side of the neck anterior to the jugular vein and internal carotid artery is another 1.5-cm enhancing lesion which likely represents a metastatic lymph node (level 3). the left piriform sinus is not seen, which can be better evaluated by direct visualization. enhancement and increased t2 signal is seen along the left anterior neck just lateral and deep to the left strap muscles which may represent post-surgical change versus infection or tumor infiltration. there is minimal enhancement and increased t2 signal in the dependent portion of the lungs, which likely represents atelectasis.
both carotid and vertebral arteries demonstrate normal flow signal without evidence of occlusion or stenosis. given the patient's large lymphadenopathy in the neck with necrotic masses and known locally invasive squamous cell carcinoma, evaluation was made for any arterial invasion. no evidence of irregularity of the vascular structures is seen to indicate arterial invasion. the venous phase of the mra demonstrates superior vena cava to be patent within the thorax. the left jugular vein is visualized in its upper portion. the lower portion of left jugular vein is not visualized, appears to be compressed and occluded by the large necrotic mass. a small component of the left jugular vein is visualized at its junction with partially visualized left subclavian vein. faint visualization of the left innominate vein is seen. the right jugular vein is not visualized throughout its length from below the level of skull base. a large mass is seen occluding the vein. small venous collaterals are seen in this region. the right subclavian vein is partially visualized with indentation at the area appropriate for its junction with the right internal jugular vein. it is unclear whether the right internal jugular vein has been invaded by the mass with tumor extending through the venous lumen to the nunction with subclavian vein.
as seen on the previous ct of ___, bilateral massive necrotic lymphadenopathy is identified extending from level ii inferiorly to level iv level and also involving the supraclavicular regions. the overall size of the lymphadenopathy has not changed compared to the prior study. diffuse edema is seen in the supraglottic region with obliteration of the airway in this region. a tracheostomy is in position. these findings have not significantly changed from the previous ct. although evaluation is limited, the flow voids of the jugular veins are not visualized on the current study. this is also not changed from the previous ct examination. diffuse soft tissue swelling is present involving the subcutaneous tissues bilaterally. at the lung apex pleural changes are visualized on the right side. no abnormalities are seen at the skull base.
postoperative changes in the suboccipital region with artifact attributable to the placement of mesh are again identified. there is some enhancing material posterior to the mesh, but no convincing evidence of a fluid collection. some high signal on the inversion recovery sequence could reflect some artifact associated with the mesh or could reflect some hematoma. there does not appear to be an enhancing fluid collection. more inferiorly in the neck, there are few scattered lymph nodes, but no significant adenopathy.
this study is technically adequate. bilateral level 2 lymph nodes are unchanged, are not pathologically enlarged and do not demonstrate necrosis. no other mass or focus of abnormal enhancement is identified. mild mucosal thickening of the right maxillary sinus is seen.
as before, there are postoperative changes within the suboccipital region with placement of mesh material. again, there is a large amorphous heterogeneous area of post-gadolinium enhancement anterior to the mesh material which appears unchanged from the prior examination. there is post- gadolinium enhancement in the subcutaneous tissues of the neck posteriorly from the level of the posterior fossa down to approximately the level of c2-3. the previously seen circular area of high t2 signal within the posterior subcutaneous tissues on the right has completely resolved. no definite new fluid collection is identified. as before, there is mass effect upon the cerebellum with deformity, unchanged. the fourth ventricle is stable in configuration. as before, there are multiple bilateral, approximately 1-cm lymph nodes in the subcutaneous fat bilaterally in the posterior cervical region.
on the axial t1 fat saturated images (series 24, image 570), there is an area of t1 hyperintensity adjacent to the right vertebral artery, which is seen on only one slice and is felt to be artifactual in nature. the post- gadolinium images demonstrate significant venous contamination, however, there is no definite caliber change within the vertebral artery at this location. a cta may be performed if clinically indicated to evaluate for vessel irregularity in this location. the remainder of the arterial structures of the neck are unremarkable. there is a pica termination of the right vertebral artery. there is metallic artifact from an anterior fusion and corpectomy in the lower cervical spine.
the origins of the arch vessels for patent. bilateral vertebral arteries, including the origins and the intracranial segments are patent and normal in caliber with no abnormal foci of signal intensity on the t1 fat saturated images. there is no evidence of vertebral artery dissection. bilateral common carotid, cervical intra- and extracranial carotid arteries are patent and normal in caliber.
the fat-suppressed images of the neck demonstrate interval resolution of previously seen signal changes within the distal left vertebral artery. the 2d time-of-flight mra images demonstrate normal flow signal in both vertebral arteries. there is normal flow signal visualized within the left vertebral artery, which is considerably improved from the previous study. the distal left vertebral artery also demonstrate normal flow signal. the gadolinium enhanced mra of the neck demonstrates normal flow signal in the left vertebral artery extending from the origin to the vertebrobasilar junction. the visualized portions of the basilar artery also demonstrate normal flow signal. there is a small right vertebral artery ending in posterior inferior cerebellar artery, as seen on the previous study.
notably, no axial fat sat t1-weighted images were performed. the vertebral arteries and carotid arteries are patent bilaterally without flow limiting stenosis. there is no evidence of pseudoaneurysm.
no prior studies are available for comparison. in the right level ii b region, medial to the sternocleidomastoid and posterior to the right internal jugular vein, there is an 11 x 7.6 mm enhancing, oval lymph node. there is no evidence of cavitation or pericapsular infiltration. a few other small lymph nodes are seen scattered throughout the neck. no definite masses are identified. there is a mucus retention cyst within the left maxillary sinus and mucosal thickening of the maxillary sinuses bilaterally. there is t2 hyperintensity and enhancement of the right maxillary molar extraction pocket.
comparison is made to a head mr from ___. the post-gadolinium images are limited as the v3 and v4 segments of the vertebral arteries were not included in the field of view, nor was the most posterior part of the distal right internal carotid artery. these segments appear normal on the 2d tof images. the visualized aortic arch appears normal. the origins of the brachiocephalic artery, common carotid arteries, and the vertebral arteries bilaterally appear patent. there is moderate narrowing of the right internal carotid artery at its bulb likely due to atherosclerotic disease. the distal right cervical internal carotid artery measures approximately 4 mm in diameter whereas the left distal cervical internal carotid artery measures 5.5 mm in diameter. the 2d time-of-flight images show a normal vertebrobasilar system.
again seen is an enhancing mass involving the tip of the epiglottis. these additional images demonstrate that the pre-epiglottic fat is not invaded, and also redemonstrates that the base of the tongue is not involved.
there is a 7 x 3.5 mm mass involving the epiglottis with its most bulbous portion at the tip of the epiglottis, some abnormality does extend down to the petiole of the epiglottis as well. no definite base of tongue abnormality is seen. there is mild soft tissue prominence in the posterior oropharyngeal mucosa which may be related to edema. there is no pathologic adenopathy by imaging criteria. there is a non specific small 6.6 mm nodule in the left thyroid lobe. it is difficult to assess for preepiglottic fat invasion on this examination. the patient will return for sagittal pre- and post- gadolinium images to assess this better.
correlation is made to an mra of the head from ___. there is apparent moderate stenosis of the origin of the left vertebral artery. the origins of the great vessels appear patent. there is narrowing of the right internal carotid artery bulb of approximately 30% by nascet criteria. there is minimal irregularity of the left internal carotid artery bulb but without significant stenosis. the distal cervical internal carotid arteries measure 5.7 mm on the right and 5.6 mm in the left. multiple short-segment stenoses of the v4 segment of the left vertebral artery are seen. there are fetal posterior cerebral arteries bilaterally.
3d tof mr angiogram of the head: the right vertebral artery is narrowed in caliber and hypoplastic. the distal vertebral arteries, basilar and posterior cerebral arteries are patent. the intracranial internal carotid arteries, including the petrous, cavernous, and the supraclinoid segments are patent. the anterior and middle cerebral arteries, and the anterior communicating arteries are patent. no focal flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm more than 3 mm, within the resolution of mr angiogram is noted.
this is a limited examination without contrast. the coronal t2- weighted sequence with fat suppression demonstrates a questionable irregular contour in the left supraclavicular region which may represent fat, however, some nodularity is identified in this region, raising the possibility of lymphadenopathy, this region was not included completely in the prior ct of the chest. there is no frank evidence of fluid collection or abscess in this region. the remainder areas of the neck, retropharyngeal space, parapharyngeal space as well as the carotid space appear within normal limits. the patient is intubated at the moment of this examination, the orotracheal tube appears in adequate position. the visualized aspect of the lungs demonstrates bilateral pleural effusions as well as plate-like atelectasis.
the visualized common and external carotid arteries are within normal limits. the visualized vertebral arteries are also patent. there is a dominant left vertebral artery. the v3 segment of both vertebral arteries is not clearly seen, likely due to in-plane flow artifact. there is moderate- severe stenosis of both proximal internal carotid arteries. the findings are more severe in the left internal carotid than the right. there is normal flow in the distal internal carotid arteries.
the t1 fat-saturated images are technically limited as all the major vessels demonstrate increased signal. this limits the evaluation for intramural hematoma and dissection. a large filling defect is again demonstrated on all sequences within the left internal carotid artery bulb extending superiorly into the proximal portion of the left internal carotid artery. allowing for differences in comparing differing modalities, the degree of occlusion and clot burden is relatively unchanged. no intimal flap is identified, though evaluation is limited as described above. the right common, external, and internal carotid arteries opacify normally. both vertebral arteries and basilar artery opacify normally. there is a pseudofilling defect within the right subclavian artery secondary to t2* artifact. the subclavian arteries are otherwise normal. diffuse degenerative changes of the cervical spine that are most severe at the c5-c6 level.
there is essentially complete occlusion of the left internal jugular vein extending to the base of the sigmoid sinus. surrounding the left internal jugular thrombosis, there is a moderate amount of ill-defined irregular signal consistent with induration/edema likely secondary to infection. given lack of iv contrast enhancement, enhancement cannot be evaluated however there is no evidence of abnormal fluid collections to suggest abscess. there are several enlarged likely reactive lymph nodes within the left neck, notably station 3, and also within the left subclavian/axillary.
the arteries of the neck are patent and within normal limits. there is absence of flow within the left internal jugular vein as well as the base of the sigmoid sinus.
the left internal carotid artery demonstrated atherosclerotic plaque causing significant stenosis at its origin. no other areas of narrowing, stenosis, occlusion or aneurysmal dilation were noted. no evidence of dissection in the cervical portions of the carotid and vertebral arteries. the distal cervical internal carotid artery measures approximately 4 mm on both sides. the stenotic segment in the origin of left internal carotid artery measures approximately 1.4 mm in cross-sectional width corresponding to approximtely more than 90% stenosis.
the study is mildly motion degraded. within limits of this examination, there is no evidence of dissection or hemodynamically significant stenosis. the right vertebral body appears to be smaller than the left, and is likely hypoplastic.
there is no evidence of dissection or flow limiting stenosis. the distal cervical ica measures 4 mm in diameter bilaterally.
abnormal foci of t2 prolongation and enhancement are again demonstrated in the c5 vertebral body and in the c5-6 intervertebral disc, however, without extension. the elongated focus of t2 prolongation in the retropharyngeal space is now smaller, extending only from c2-c6. the fat plane between the retropharyngeal space and the perivertebral space is preserved except at the c5-6 level. other notable findings include intubation and high t2 signal in the right mastoid air cells, indicating fluid. a large pleural effusion is seen in the right lung apex.
in the visualized posterior fossa an irregularly rim-enhancing lesion is identified in the left cerebellar hemisphere measuring approximately 2 cm with surrounding edema and mass effect on the fourth ventricle as seen on the previous brain mri. the central portion of this lesion demonstrate low t2 signal indicating blood products. the evaluation of soft tissue structures of the neck demonstrate no evidence of lymphadenopathy or a discrete mass lesion. there is no evidence of abnormal enhancement identified. the vertebral bodies demonstrate normal signal without mass or epidural lesion. the nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and the glottic and subglottic regions demonstrate normal appearances without evidence of mass lesion. the visualized mandible demonstrates normal marrow signal. the floor of the mouth demonstrate normal signal intensities with symmetric soft tissues. the parotid and submandibular glands are symmetric and normal in signal intensities without mass or abnormal enhancement.
neck mra demonstrates normal flow signal in the carotid and vertebral arteries. no evidence of stenosis or occlusion seen.
the fat-suppressed axial images of the neck demonstrate no evidence of blood products adjacent to the carotid or vertebral arteries to indicate dissection. the mra demonstrates normal flow signal in the carotid and vertebral arteries without evidence of dissection or occlusion.
fat suppressed images demonstrate no evidence of dissection. 3d time-of-flight mra and gadolinium-enhanced mra demonstrate normal vascular structures in the neck without evidence of dissection or stenosis.
comparison was made with the previous ct of the neck of ___. the right internal jugular vein is visualized from the jugular bulb to the thoracic inlet. the right transverse sinus is also visualized and appears normal. the left transverse sinus and the sigmoid sinus are visualized. the left jugular bulb is not well visualized. the previously noted left internal jugular vein is no longer visible throughout the neck from the skull base to the thoracic inlet region. left external jugular vein is visualized in its lower portion.
