1. bilateral adenxal tumors with resultant bilateral hydronephrosis, right side greater than left, most likely metastatic, (___).
1. due to the patient's previous adverse reaction to gadolinium no contrast was injected. 2. there is ill-defined abnormal soft tissue signal intensity on the left, presumably in the region of the recent surgery. nearby susceptibility artifact raises the question of a surgical clip in this location, but could also be secondary to prior (transient) instrumentation -- clinical correlation requested. 3. left hydroureter and mild hydronephrosis, new since ___ ct. the transition point lies near the soft tissue intensity material and susceptibility artifact. however, due to the artifact, it is difficult to confirm the exact point of transtion in relation to these findings and, therefore, it could relate to either finding.
1. large mass in the right hemipelvis as described above with obstruction of the distal ureters and invasion of the right side of the sacrum. 2. thrombosis of the right iliac vein and right common femoral vein. 3. right-sided hydronephrosis. 4. diffuse wall thickening in the bowel possibly related to prior radiotherapy.
tiny well-circumscribed pelvic hematoma. the appearances would not necessarily explain a 12 point hematocrit drop.
thickening of the left posterolateral bladder wall without abnormal enhancement is probably due to post-surgical change from the left ureteral re-implantation surgery. susceptibility artifact from surgical clips in the left pelvis limit evaluation of this area, but taking this into account, there is no evidence of local recurrence in the left paravaginal or pararectal areas. there are no areas of abnormal enhancement in the pelvis.
1. no evidence of dvt. 2. two pelvic lesions as described that might represent either primary adnexal masses or secondary involvement from known breast cancer. further evaluation may be warranted. 3. hyperintense bone marrow regions seen in the ischium and in the femoral heads. this might also be attributed to the patient's primary disease.
1. there is evidence of discitis and enhancement at the level of l2-3 with loss of height of the disc and vivid enhancement around it with extension bilaterally to both psoas muscles. the right psoas shows findings compatible with an abscess. on the left the enhancement is seen to extend for a larger length but without changes that are compatible with liquifaction. these findings are compatible with discitis and possibly osteomyelitis with extension to adjacent psoas muscles.
foci of t1 hypointensity and t2 hyperintensity within the left superior and inferior pubic rami with adjacent t2 signal within the musculature. this is suspicious for metastasis to these osseous structures and microinvasion of the adjacent musculature cannot be excluded.

enlarging edematous transplant kidney with striated nephrogram, possibly representing rejection vs. infection. areas of decreased enhancement in the upper pole are likely secondary to decreased segmental perfusion. pseudoaneurysm formation at the site of anastomosis. the pseudoaneurysm is bilobed with each lobe measuring approximately 2 cm in diameter. perinephric collection, not well demonstrated previously, but likely unchanged in size from the previous exam. the collection most likely represents evolving postoperative hematoma. thrombosis of the right external iliac artery with reconstitution immediately proximal to the right common femoral artery (at the level of the inferior pole of the transplanted kidney). high signal intensity of the thrombus suggests subacute thrombosis. these findings were discussed with dr. ___ ___ on ___ at 10:00pm.
1. t2 hyperintensity and abnormal enhancement involving bilateral pubic symphysis, compatible with osteomyelitis. 2. fluid collections anterior and posterior to the pubic symphysis and between bilateral symphysis, compabtible with abscesses. sinus tract anterior to the pubic symphysis. 3. although findings are compatible with infection, small tumor involvement of these areas can not be excluded.
1. limited examination demonstrates no evidence of definite tumor recurrence in pelvis. there is no evidence of hydronephrosis. the diverting ileostomy is patent. 2. soft tissue signal at the anterior pelvic floor, which could represent post surgical, radiation changes or inflammation. correlation with clinical exam is advised. see comment.

rectal prolapse. focal enhancement in the midline posterior rectum at 1.5 cm above the distal rectum, which probably represents a fissure or ulcer. patient will be brought back for dynamic study (during valsalva manuever) to furher evaluate the possibility of bladder prolapse during stress. findings were discussed with dr. ___ upon reviewing the study.
resolution of cystic appearance in the right adnexa, which likely was caused by fluid within the rectal pouch. no worrisome adnexal lesions.
1. no significant change of l5 and s1 osseous destruction, with associated paraspinal collections, secondary to a large decubitus ulcer arising from approximately the l2 vertebral level. 2. no change of multiple pelvic decubitus ulcers, fistulous tracts, and inflammatory processes surrounding both hip joints, both ischiums, and the rectum. as noted previously, it is not possible to determine whether a patent fistulous tract exists to the patient's rectal remnant. 3. extensive bone marrow signal abnormality within both proximal femurs, the right inferior pubic ramus, the sacrum, and both iliac bones adjacent to the si joints. these findings are nonspecific and may represent reactive marrow edema or osteomyelitis. 4. unchanged size of the fluid collection in the region of destroyed l5 vertebral body.

1) multifocal fluid-containing thick-walled lesions within the bilateral vulva and both groins, left greater than right, with an appearance highly suspicious for vulvar cancer with necrotic lymph nodes along bilateral pelvic nodal chains. irregularity, rim enhancement and surrounding inflammatory fat stranding in the left groin may indicate superimposed infection. 2) extrinsic compression without occlusion of the proximal left external iliac vein just central to the distal left common femoral vein. this extrinsic compression is caused by an adjacent necrotic lymph node. 3) 2-cm mass with papillary surface projecting into the bladder lumen from the right bladder wall has an appearance highly suspicious for transitional cell carcinoma. less likely, this may alternatively represent a bladder wall metastasis. cystocopy is recommended for tissue characterization.
resolution of left psoas collection.
1) stent is demonstrated throughout the length of the distal left ureter which is not dilated. enhancement of the wall of the left ureter may be a result of manipulation due to placement of the stent, or less likely, secondary to inflammation. there is no encasement or mass involving the course of the left ureter. 2) large exophytic cyst related to the left ovary with a smaller adjacent non- enhancing hemorrhagic cyst. follow-up ultrasound in six weeks is suggested, as also suggested on the ultrasound, to document disappearance of this cyst.

normal vasculature of the inflow and outflow vessels up to the level of the ankle bilaterally. dedicated evaluation of the right foot vessels can be performed if so clinically indicated in case there is proposed vascular surgery. enhancement around the left ankle which can be related to the patient's known neuropathic joint. these findings were discussed with the clinical service at the time of interpretation.
1) predominant inflow disease with 4.4 cm segment of non-visualization of the proximal left common iliac artery and moderate degree of stenosis and plaque within the proximal right common iliac artery. 2) scattered foci of moderate to severe stenosis at the origin of the right external iliac and within the right common femoral artery. 3) relatively normal appearance of the superficial, popliteal and below knee vessels bilaterally. 4) significant left renal artery stenosis and mild right renal artery stenosis with atherosclerotic changes within the visualized abdominal aorta. these findings were telephonically conveyed to dr. ___ ___ ___ on ___.
stable appearance of sacral mass which is non-enhancing and predominantly of fluid and fat signal intensity, which suggests the diagnosis of teratoma.
1. left sacral decubitus ulcer with abnormal coccygeal signal. osteomyelitis is not excluded. 2. sacral and left iliac lesions are nonspecific and may represent normal red marrow, metastases, or myeloma. clinical correlation is recommended. 3. incompletely imaged right kidney which continues to demonstrate perinephric edema, consistent with the finding of the right ureteral calculus on recent ct scan.
small mass in the spinal canal at s1/2. this could be either skeletal or neurogenic in origin. a ct study is suggested to assess for osseous involvement.
1. asymmetric enlargement of the right labia majora, with edema and asymmetric thickening of the medial aspect of the right labia. this may be secondary to an infectious or inflammatory process, but direct involvement by lymphoma should be considered. 2. no evidence of abscess or fasciitis. 3. superficial subcutaneous edema involving the anterior aspect of both thighs. 4. bilateral iliac lymphadenopathy, left greater than the right. 5. heterogeneous bone marrow signal within the proximal portions of both proximal femurs, likely related to the patient's history of lymphoma. 6. small free fluid in the pelvis.
1. edema or minimal fluid within the left sacroiliac joint, and edema within the adjacent soft tissues, extending through the sciatic notch. findings concerning for underlying infectious etiology. no abcess is identified. minimal marrow edema within the left sacrum may be reactive; while, osteomyelitis cannot be entirely excluded, it is thought less likely. 2. sacral decubitus ulcer. 3. avascular necrosis of the left femoral head without evidence of collapse. findings discussed with dr. ___ on ___.

interval small decrease in size of the enhancing mass lesion at the rectal anastomosis site. the distribution and extension of the mass is the same, with invasion of the posterior wall of the urinary bladder. although the decreased size of the mass suggests interval response to chemotherapy, there are new enhancing lymph nodes in the perirectal distribution, which could be reactive to underlying chemotherapy, however, regional new metastases cannot be excluded. in addition, there is more extensive central enhancement on today's examination, with a decrease in the area of central desmoplastic change (or necrosis) seen on the ___ exam -- the signifiance of this latter finding is uncertain. of note, the liver was not included in the field-of-view on today's images. multiplanar and multiphasic imaging was essential for depiction of anatomy in this case.
prematurely terminated and limited exam, however, still showing copious ascites with features of nodularity and a distended fluid filled uterus with nodule or mass like features centrally. the overall pattern is consistent with uterine cancer, perhaps metastatic and there is evidence of right external iliac adenopathy. the patient can be made comfortable, full evaluation could be achieved with gadolinium injection as clinically indicated.

1. findings highly suspicious for discitis at the l4-5 level. 2. 3.3 x 2.6 x 3.1 cm right adnexal mass, as described above. findings are most consistent with a stromal tumor arising from the right ovary, such as a fibroma, ___ tumor or fibrothecoma. although, no connection to the uterus is identified, a pedunculated fibroid would also be in the differential. hemosiderin within an endometrioma is considered unlikely in someone of this age. 3. findings were discussed with dr. ___ at approximately 10:15 a.m. on this day (___).
widespread osseous metastatic disease to all visualized bones including focal metastases at the s2 level; suspicion for continuity to the exiting s2 nerve root is present, and this may contribute to the patient's symptoms. however, the osseous metastatic lesions on the left as described above may also be contributory. multiplanar reformations were essential in delineating enhancement features in this case.
punctate focus of air in the fundus of the uterus; reconstructed images show thin tracts between the sigmoid colon and the fundus of the uterus highly suggestive of small fistulae. of note, precontrast t1 images show high signal fluid in all bowel contents, however, none is seen in the endometrial cavity. free fluid seen. some third spacing of fluid also noted in a tarlov's cyst was incidentally seen. tiny filling defect in distal right ureter with some enhancement. this is consistent with ureteral stone but small stricture cannot be ruled out. multiplanar reformations were essential in demonstrating the small fistulous tracts as described above.
1. calcified pedunculated fibroid in the pelvis. 2. diverticula in the sigmoid colon without diverticulitis. team contact___ with findings.
1. technically limited study, as described above, due to patient motion as well as some venous contamination, particularly on the right. there is artifact from stents in the region of both proximal common iliac arteries, and these portions of the vessels cannot be evaluated. 2. a long segment of nonvisualization of the right superficial femoral artery. given the abrupt cutoff and reappearance of this vessel, this likely relates to the presence of metallic stents in this region rather than long segment stenosis. clinical correlation is recommended. 3. a somewhat diminutive appearance of the right anterior tibial artery proximally, though this appears improved from the prior mra dated ___. 4. focal high-grade stenosis/occlusion of the proximal aspect of the right dorsalis pedis artery. the more distal vessel appears patent. 5. disease of the right tibioperoneal trunk. 6. multiple focal areas of mild disease within the left superficial femoral artery. 7. focal moderate high-grade stenosis of the distal left popliteal artery, just above the takeoff of the left anterior tibial artery. 8. mild-moderate disease of the left anterior tibial artery and tibioperoneal trunk.

1. resolution of the large fluid collections within the right abductor muscles and lateral right hip. there is no suspicious focal fluid collection to suggest residual abscess, hematoma, or seroma. 2. there is abnormal enhancement and inflammation over the lower right anterior pelvis. this involves the pubic symphysis, right superior pubic ramus and surrounding soft tissues. signal is likely related to the history of trauma and fracture in this region, although superimposed infection is difficult to exclude clearly on imaging findings. 3. there is enhancement and edema within the both right and left anterior inferior iliac crests likely related to the recently removed external fixator devices. a small amount of fluid surrounds the inferior right iliac bone and is interposed between the iliac bone and iliacus muscle.
bilateral masses with a large intrapelvic component, larger on the right, which appear related to the joints. evaluation is suboptimal. these masses were present on the prior ct examination, but appear somewhat smaller in size. hematoma is not considered likely due to the chronicity. however, given the history of multiple hip replacements, the bilaterallity, and the unusual appearance of these lesions, foremost consideration is given to a foreign-body reaction. less likely would be a proliferative synovial condition such as pvns, or synovial chondromatosis. nondiagnostic arterial and venous evaluation.
1. complex pelvic fluid collections with nodular septal enhancement. no discrete enhancing masses. 2. multiple uterine fibroids, the largest measuring up to 13.2 cm. 3. submucosal fibroid versus adenomyoma. 4. 3.5 cm right ovarian cyst. given patient's age, followup imaging is recommended. addendum ___: the possibility of an underlying mucinous neoplasm cannot be entirely excluded and should be considered in the differential.

1. dissection and pseudoaneurysm (that appears completely thrombosed) of the right internal iliac artery, extensively involving the superior vesical artery and measuring up to 2.9 cm in diameter. 2. 1.8 x 1.0 cm partially enhancing structure in the right pelvic sidewall likely represents an additional thrombosed vessel and pseudoaneurysm with flow within the non- thrombosed portion of the lumen. 3. nonocclusive plaque in the left internal iliac artery. these results were discussed with ___ ___ on ___, at 12:30 p.m. via telephone message and at 4:50 p.m. via telephone conversation. findings of dissection and pseudoaneurysm, and potential risk of rupture, were discussed.
1. again seen are multiple bone lesions within the lower lumbar spine, sacrum, and iliac wings, which are similar in distribution, but slightly smaller in size in comparison to the prior study. 2. hypointense mass in the liver is not well visualized on this study, and more completely assessed on the prior ct scan from ___. 3. post-surgical changes within the region of the right hip, including atrophy of the right iliopsoas, gluteus medius, and rectus femoris muscles.
abnormal enlargement and enhancement of the l5, s1 and s2 nerve roots, right greater than left, most notably involving the right l5 nerve root. this has progressed appreciably since the ct of ___ and likely represents lymphomatous involvement.
1. very large right adnexal cystic lesion most consistent with a peritoneal inclusion cyst, not significantly changed since the prior examinations. 2. interval decrease in size of the previously noted right adnexal hemorrhagic cyst. 3. wall thickening and enhancement of the sigmoid colon with adjacent fibrofatty proliferation consistent with the patient's known crohn's disease.

1. interval development of diffuse signal abnormality and diffuse enhancement within the pelvis consistent with phlegmon. infectious etiology seems the most likely given the time course and rapid change. in addition, the signal characteristics are not consistent with other possible etiologies such as pseudomyxoma peritonei. 2. persistent bilateral complex adnexal masses which are consistent with prior imaging studies, and are likely representative of tubo-ovarian abscesses. a component of hydrosalpinx may also be present. the findings were discussed with the ob/gyn physician, ___. ___ ___.
post-surgical change involving the right iliac bone with high t1 and t2 signal relating to postoperative hemorrhage. there is a t2 bright fluid collection tracking along the anterior right abdominal musculature culminating in approximately 1 cm focal collection. while this may represent postoperative hematoma/seroma, an infectious process cannot be excluded. findings discussed with dr. ___ ___ on ___ at 10 a.m. dr. ___ ___ ___
large mildly complex cystic lesion in the pelvis closely associated with the distal large bowel. differential considerations include a duplication cyst or giant sigmoid diverticulum. however, an unusual appearance of a cystic gastrointestinal stromal tumor, or less likely a paraganglioma, cannot be excluded. in order to assess further for solid vascular components, ultrasound examination with doppler is suggested. depending on the results, a ct with contrast could also be helpful. findings and recommendations discussed with dr. ___ ___ on the same day.
1. relatively ___ bilateral complex cystic adnexal masses with diffuse enhancement within the pelvis with tethering of adjacent bowel loops. given that the cytology was shown to demonstrate mullerian adenocarcinoma, the findings are concerning for extensive pelvic disease with peritoneal and mesenteric involvement; infectious compomemt may be present. 2. luminal endometrial lesion in the distal anterior uterus measuring 13 mm. it may represent a proteinaceous or hemorrhagic cystic lesion.
1. approximately 6 x 4 x 4 cm (ap, transverse, cc) collection centered in the left pectineus, adductor magnus, and obturator externus, with mr characteristics suggestive of a hematoma. the presence or absence of superimposed infection cannot be excluded by imaging. 2. extensive bony lesions throughout the osseous pelvis and through much of the left femur, all likely metastases. the extent of involvement in the left femur raises concern for future pathologic fracture, though, at present, the bulk of the bony cortex is intact. 3. right proximal femur and adjacent right osseous pelvis is largely obscured by susceptibility artifact.
1) severely limited study for reasons stated above. 2) bilateral femoral avascular necrosis with severe underlying osteoarthritis. 3) prominent bilateral subcutaneous edema and edema tracking along the adductor musculature bilaterally. 4) study not of diagnostic quality to assess the psoas muscles or exclude deep abscess.
1) bilateral sacroiliitis, consisting primarily of sclerosis with faint edema and enhancement about the superior aspect and small osteophytes. no erosions or effusions. given these findings, a degenerative process with altered biomechanics is favored over an inflammatory etiology, though correlate with clinical presentation and lab values. 2) ill-defined edema involving the left paraspinal musculature, incompletely imaged on this study, of unclear etiology and clinical significance. 3) left iliac chain and obturator internus lymphadenopathy.
1. simple 8.1 cm right adnexal cyst. correlation with ca-125 level is recommended. if the ca-125 level is elevated, then surgical excision would be prudent. otherwise, followup mri in six months could be considered. 2. two small tarlov cysts at the sacrum. 3. lumbar dextroscoliosis and degenerative changes.
1. overall decrease in size of large mass centered in the right iliac bone, crossing the sacroiliac joint with remodeling of the sacral ala. osseous remodeling and expansion again identified in the right iliac ___. lack of intravenous contrast limits assessment for potential extent of necrosis within the lesion. 2. new right hip effusion. 3. evidence of remote nondisplaced right acetabular fracture again identified. findings were discussed with ___ ___ on ___.
1. mixed signal intensity mass in the left ovary which appears to have hemorrhagic and fibrous components. findings compatible with fibrous solid neoplasm like a fibroma or fibrothecoma. hemorrhagic cystic components could be explained with post-torsion changes. alternatively, this mass could represent a mixed ___ tumor with mucinous cystic component. 2. possible left hydrosalpinx. 3. minimal probable inflammatory changes in the medial right gluteus maximus muscle. advise clinical correlation.
marrow edema and enhancement in the s4, s5, and c1 levels, concerning for osteomyelitis in the appropriate clinical setting. overlying sinus tract and phlegmonous changes in the soft tissues. 1.5 x 1.0 cm peripherally enhancing focus in the inferior extent of the spinal canal, adjacent to s4, which is stable compared to the prior study from ___. anomalous appearance of spinal canal on the ct from ___ ___. further assessment with dedicated ct of the sacrum with thin sections is recommended for further evaluation. caudal segments of the coccyx not seen on current exam; unclear if these were resected or have been eroded secondary to infectious or inflammatory process; recommend ct for further evaluation as above. these findings were discussed with dr. ___ on ___.
1. t3 rectal tumor with abnormal soft tissue extending anterior to the mass into the mesorectal fat. 2. multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes extending along the inferior mesenteric vein territory.
1. degenerative change in the visualized lumbar spine with disc bulges at the l3-l4 and l4-l5 levels and some exit foraminal stenosis noted at the left l4 level. 2. high signal intensity within the l5-s1 disc on t2-weighted imaging. while this likely represents an unusual appearance of degenerative change, the differential includes discitis. clinical correlation is advised and if indicated, perhaps an mri lumbar spine with and without contrast should be performed. 3. large uterine fibroid measuring 6 cm in maximum dimension. an email has been sent to dr ___ regarding these findings.
there is a moderate-sized, somewhat ill-defined focus of abnormal signal intensity, primarily in the left sacral ala and minimally in the right sacral ala. the patient has evidence of compression fractures in the lumbar spine (the lumbar spine mri will be dictated separately). the patient also reports history of severe osteopenia. given this history and concomitant findings in the lumbar spine, the findings in the left hemisacrum are most likely represent insufficiency fracture. a ct is recommended in 3 months to assess for fracture line and possible interval healing.
1. no rectovaginal fistula demonstrated. no fistula to the uterus seen on images covering the entire uterus, however, contrast-enhanced imaging did not cover the entire uterus. 2. trabeculated, thickened urinary bladder wall, likely neurogenic. 3. trace free fluid in the pelvis. 4. small uterine fibroid.
1. known right iliac ___ metastatic lesion, with areas of osseous destruction and surrounding soft tissue edema and soft tissue mass. 2. no evidence of femur fracture or avascular necrosis. 3. no evidence for bursitis. nonspecific reticular edema in subcutaneous fat bilaterally. 4. additional nonspecific areas of t2 hyperintensity are not fully characterized but could represent additional small metatatic lesions.
1. the patient appears to have a fibroid uterus. there is a dominant fibroid which is intramural in the left side of the uterus. there is also a right posterior lower uterine segment probable fibroid. this enhances homogeneously and corresponds to the highly fdg-avid lesion seen on the pet-ct from ___. when compared with the ct of ___ it appears slightly smaller. the imaging appearance is suggestive of a fibroid. recommend followup study in six months if surgical excision is not performed. 2. normal appearance of the ovaries.
there is extensive inflammatory change involving the medial gluteal creases bilaterally, which extend to involve the perianal region, primarily the external sphincter and perianal fat on the right side greater than left. no distinct fistula or abscess is identified. findings are probably due to cellulitis extending to the perianal region/external sphincter. dfddp
1. large sacral/coccygeal decubitus ulcer extending up to the inferior sacrum. abnormal signal involves both sides of the inferior sacrum, likely from a combination of osteomyelitis. te possibility of a superimposed nondisplaced left sacral alar insufficiency fracture cannot be excluded. 2. 2.6- cm rim-enhancing high t2 structure in the left gluteal soft tissues lateral to and apparently communicating with the ulcer tract -- ? abcess collection vs packing material in recess of ulcer. please see comment above. 3. stable appearance of the ulcer tracts extending up to the ischial tuberosities bilaterally with abnormal signal and enhancement about the posterior aspect of the ischial tuberosities, consistent with osteomyelitis. 4. old left intertrochanteric fracture only partially imaged on today's study. 5. prominent sacral tarlov's cysts. 6. suprapubic catheter seen approaching the bladder; it is difficult on the images performed today to determine if the balloon and tip are in fact within the bladder lumen. clinical correlation is therefore requested -- is this tube draining urine?. 7. distended large bowel most consistent with ileus.
1. marked improvement in metastatic lesion along the right anterolateral abdominal wall. 2. slightly improved appearance of solid tissue in the operative bed posterior to the nephrectomy site, which may reflect both inflammatory change and solid tumor. 3. larger fluid collection compared to the prior mr, although little changed from a recent ct, which is intimately associated with the adjacent hepatic flexure and almost inseparable from it.
1. extensive thrombosis of the inferior vena cava, extending from the level of the inferior vena cava filter inferiorly into the common iliac vein on the left and through the external iliac vein on the right. 2. mild splenomegaly. 3. moderate to severe l1 compression fracture with retropulsion into the spinal canal. if clinically indicated, a lumbar mri would provide superior evaluation.
1. occlusive thrombus in the left common femoral vein and visualized superficial femoral vein. near-occlusive thrombus in the left external iliac vein. 2. filter in the inferior vena cava. no evidence of thrombus within the inferior vena cava. 3. multiple liver, bony, and soft tissue metastases as described. 4. renal transplant in the left lower quadrant. findings of the study were discussed with dr. ___ ___ on ___ at 15:50 hours.
bilateral hypoenhancing low signal ovarian masses, greater in size on the right, more likely represent fibroma or fibrothecoma. dr. ___ ___ posted these findings to the radiology department critical results reporting dashboard on ___ for communication to dr. ___ ___.
small track, measuring 14 mm in depth, extending from the skin of the right thigh to the fascia abutting the gracilis, with no evidence of deeper extension and no evidence of fistula or abscess, as questioned. trace bilateral hydroceles.
1. dominant fluid collection in the right side of the pelvis which is compatible with a peritoneal inclusion cyst. 2. there is a multiloculated complex lesion in the right adnexa, along the wall of the presumed peritoneal inclusion cyst, which is probably a cystic lesion in the right ovary. this could be due to multiple functional cysts in the right ovary. recommend six-week followup ultrasound to assess for change and also suggest correlation with patient's history to see if the patient is still menstruating. if this is persistent or growing after six-week ultrasound, consider laparoscopy. critical finding notification was posted in info radiology.
1. bilateral gluteal muscle edema and to a much lesser extent edema in the erector spinae and iliacus muscles. the findings are compatible with non-specific myositis. 2. no evidence of osteomyelitis. 3. sacral decubitus ulcer.
1. sacral decubitus ulcer extending to the sacrococcygeal junction with evidence of marrow signal abnormality and enhancement at the right inferolateral aspect of the right sacral ala, compatible with chronic osteomyelitis. enhancement of the inferior aspect of the sacral canal is also demonstrated. 2. bilateral avn at both femoral heads. submitted to critical reports dashboard.
1. non-occlusive thrombosis of the proximal left superficial femoral vein. 2. inferior vena cava filter in place without evidence of inferior vena cava clot. 3. small amount of ascites. 4. mild left renal caliectasis. 5. subcutaneous edema in the abdominal wall. dfddp
1. the anal tumor appears to extend into the distal-most rectum for approximately the anterior margin through the left lateral margin. there appears to be involvement of the levator muscle on the left as well as possibly the prostate. 2. 6-mm iliac chain lymph node. 3. bone marrow signal abnormality likely reflecting the patient's underlying leukemia.
1. circumferential rectal wall thickening which demonstrates symmetrical and uniform enhancement, most consistent with proctitis. the findings are not significantly changed from ___. small hemorrhoids are likely present just inferior to the region of rectal wall thickening and enhancement. 2. sigmoid diverticulosis. 3. uterine fibroids, measuring up to 3 cm in size.
1. no interval change in soft tissue ulcer with coccygeal osteomyelitis. 2. no interval change in diffuse muscle edema. the distribution of muscle edema is again unusual. given the clinical history, a neurologic deficit attributable to the spinal cord and associated denervation edema could explain the plevic and distal findings with concomitent sparing of the illiopsoas and paraspinal musculature. 3. no interval change in moderate bilateral hip effusions.
1. normal mri of the sacral plexus. specifically, no mr evidence of schwannoma. 2. status post hysterectomy.
1. decrease in inflammatory changes in the prostate, particularly on the left side. there is a small focal area of probable abscess in the right prostate apex and less well-defined in the left apex. 2. inflammatory changes in the right bladder wall and adjacent perivesical fat again noted.
